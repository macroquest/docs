# TLO:Event

## Description

This is currenly not a supported TLO. This page was added as a visual representation of JacenSolo's idea for an Event TLO. In theory, this TLO would allow access to information regarding Events, such as if any had been triggered.

## Forms

* [_event_](../data-types/datatype-event.md) **Event**

## Access to Types

* [_event_](../data-types/datatype-event.md) **event**

## Examples
