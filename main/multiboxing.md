# Multiboxing

`Multiboxing` is not to be confused with `botting`. This article has been updated to describe the differences.

* `Multiboxing` describes the act of playing and controlling multiple characters at the same time, usually in an

  MMORPG. **Multiboxing, even with specialized Multiboxing Software like [ISBoxer](http://isboxer.com), is a EULA-safe

  activity as long as it is not combined with unsafe activity like botting or hacking.** See the main

  [Multiboxing](http://isboxer.com/wiki/Multiboxing) wiki article on isboxer.com for more information about licit

  multiboxing.

* `Botting` describes the act of automating a character, generally such that the character is capable of interpreting

  and responding to game events without human control. **Botting is prohibited by the EULA in EverQuest and other

  MMORPGs.**

The remainder of the article continues to focus on _botting_ and multi-botting, rather than _multiboxing_.

## Controlling bots

Prior to MQ controlling bots was best handled by the creation of many specific hotkeys and moving between instances of EQ to click those hotkeys. MQ provides several macros such as [AutoBot.mac](../macros/gallery/autobot.mac.md) and [ModBot](../macros/gallery/modbot.md) and a plugin or two like [MQ2Melee](../plugins/community-plugins/mq2melee.md) that provide some ability for bots to act on their own.

### Communication between EQ instances

There are several ways that bots can communicate between EQ instances. You can set up a shared chat channel in EQ. One character can write a formatted message to the channel that bots can read and respond. You can also use [MQ2IRC](../plugins/discontinued/mq2irc/), [MQ2Telnet](../plugins/discontinued/mq2telnet/) or [MQ2EQBC](../plugins/community-plugins/mq2eqbc/) that all keep the communication outside of EQ.

Once your bots are setup and running you can use [Custom UIs](./features/custom-uis.md) or [MQ2HUD](../plugins/core-plugins/mq2hud/) to see information about each of your bots. You can use EQ HotKeys to send commands to your bots.
