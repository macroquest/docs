# `cachedbuff`

!!! info

    "Cached Buffs" used to be a new way to access buff information on players without needing to re-target them. Now, this functionality
    is fully integrated into MacroQuest and available through the [buff](datatype-buff.md) datatype. As a result, using cached
    buffs is now discouraged.

    You should only used this type if you need access to its "unique" style of buff lookup.

Information about cached buffs on a player. Data must be populated on a player by first targeting them.

See also: [Cached Buffs](../../main/features/cached-buffs.md).

        ```
        /echo ${Group.Member[2].CachedBuff[Spirit of Wolf].Duration}
        ```

    === "Lua"

        Check the time left on a group member's buff. Assumes that data has already been populated by targeting them
        at some point in the recent past.
