### Achievement State

An achievement has one of the following mutually exclusive states, accessed via **State**

| State | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| OPEN | The achievement is available and not completed. |
| COMPLETED | The achievement has been completed |
| LOCKED | The achievement is "locked" and has criteria that must be completed to be unlocked. |
| HIDDEN | The achievement is hidden and not available to be earned. Hidden achievements include those that do not apply to the current character class. |

### Achievement Icon

Each achievement has an icon associated with it. This icon id represents a cell in the `A_DragItem` texture. To access the cell, subtract 500 from the icon id.

### Examples

Link an achievement into chat

=== "MQScript"

    ```text
    /say This is an achievement link: ${Achievement[2801001].Link}
    ```

=== "Lua"

    ```lua
    mq.cmdf("/say This is an achievement link: %s", mq.TLO.Achievement(2801001).Link())
    ```

Print a message if an achievement has been completed. This example also demonstrates how to properly use an achievement index.

=== "MQScript"

    ```text
    | 500980300 = Wayfarers Brotherhood Adventurer's Stone (Various 20+)
    /declare achievementIndex int local ${Achievement[500980300].Index}
    /echo ${achievementIndex}

    /if (${Achievement.AchievementByIndex[${achievementIndex}].Completed}) {
        /echo ${Achievement.AchievementByIndex[${achievementIndex}].Name} is completed on ${Achievement.AchievementByIndex[${achievementIndex}].CompletedTime.Date}
    } else {
        /echo ${Achievement.AchievementByIndex[${achievementIndex}].Name} is not completed!
    }
    ```

=== "Lua"

    ```lua
    -- 500980300 = Wayfarers Brotherhood Adventurer's Stone (Various 20+)
    local achievementIndex = mq.TLO.Achievement(500980300).Index()

    local achievement = mq.TLO.Achievement.AchievementByIndex(achievementIndex)
    if achievement.Completed() then
        print(string.format('%s is completed on %s', achievement.Name(), achievement.CompletedTime.Date()))
    else
        print(achievement.Name() .. ' is not completed!')
    end
    ```


Print how many humans you have left to kill for the "**I'm a People Person!**" achievement

=== "MQScript"

    ```
    | 11000028 = I'm a People Person!
    /if (${Achievement[11000028].Completed}) {
        /echo ${Achievement[11000028].Name} is complete!
    } else {
        | 300197 = Humans
        /if (!${Achievement[11000028].Objective[300197].Completed}) {
            /echo You have ${Math.Calc[${Achievement[11000028].Objective[300197].RequiredCount} - ${Achievement[11000028].Objective[300197].Count}].Int} humans left to kill!
        } else {
            /echo Done killing humans!
        }
    }
    ```

=== "Lua"

    ```lua
    local achievement = mq.TLO.Achievement("I'm a People Person!")

    if achievement.Completed() then
        print("Achievement completed!")
    else
        local objective = achievement.Objective("Humans")
        if not objective.Completed() then
            print(string.format("You have %d humans left to kill!", objective.RequiredCount() - objective.Count()))
        else
            print("Done killing humans!")
        end
    end
    ```
