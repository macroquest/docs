[_spawn_][spawn] **NearestSpawn**[_search_]

:   The nearest spawn matching this search string (see [Spawn Search]).

[_spawn_][spawn] **NearestSpawn**[_N_,_search_]

:   The _Nth_ nearest spawn matching this search string (see [Spawn Search]).

## Examples

```
/echo ${NearestSpawn[npc radius 100 "orc pawn"]}
```

```

```
