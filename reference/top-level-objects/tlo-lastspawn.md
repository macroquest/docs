# `LastSpawn`

Information about the spawns that have occurred since you entered the zone. When you enter a zone you dont know the spawn order of anything already there, just anything that spawns while you are in the zone.

The useful thing about ${LastSpawn[-1]} is just being able to get the first spawn in the list which you might use in conjunction with other spawn members to go through the entire spawn list in a loop.

## Forms

|  |  |
| :--- | :--- |
| [_spawn_](../data-types/datatype-spawn.md) **LastSpawn[**n**]** | The nth latest spawn (chronological order) |
| [_spawn_](../data-types/datatype-spawn.md) **LastSpawn[**-n**]** | The nth oldest spawn (chronological order) |


## Examples

`/echo ${LastSpawn[10].ID}`

Echos the spawnID of the 10th mob to spawn in the zone

`/echo ${LastSpawn[-10]}`

Echos the name of the 10th to last spawn in the zone
