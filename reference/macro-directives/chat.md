# \#chat

## Description

\#chat channel

This is a special type of \#event which watches the specified channel. Content from the channel is accessed by creating a Sub Event\_Chat.

## Use

Valid channels are: tell, group, raid, ooc, say, shout, guild, auc, _chat_ (_chat_ represents channels)

Only one channel may be used on the \#chat line, however multiple lines may be added.

## Example

```text
#chat guild
#chat group

Sub Event_Chat(Channel,Sender,Text)
  /echo ${Sender} told me ${Text} in ${Channel}
/return
```

This would trigger Event\_Chat for both guild and group chat.

```text
/if (${Text.Find[send me to]} && ${Select[${Me.Class.ShortName},DRU,WIZ]}) {
  /call SendUs ${Text.Arg[4]} ${Sender}
  /return
}
```

This would watch for the key phrase "send me to" and then call the subroutine SendUs with the keyword following the phrase.

Ex "/g send me to pok" would man the keyword was pok, and the subroutine would cast the appropriate spell to send you to Plane of Knowledge.

```text
/if (${Text.Find[open door]} || ${Text.Find[click door]}) {
  /doortarget
  /delay 1s
  /face door
  /if (${DoorTarget.Distance}>20) {
    /click left door
  }
}
```

In this instance the macro would watch for the key phrase "open door" or "click door" and, provide the door was with in twenty feet, click on the door.
