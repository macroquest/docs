### Tutorial Macro

```text
#event stuff "Ant Bat Cat Dog Emu"
#event stuff "Ant #*# Cat"
#event stuff "|${Me.Name}| is cool"

sub main
   /echo starting ${Macro.Name}
   :loop
      /delay 1s
      /doevents
   /goto :loop
/return

sub event_stuff(Line, word1, word2, word3, word4)
   /echo ${word1}, ${word2}
/return
```

### Triggering your sub event\_stuff

This code will watch EQ chat for an exact message of "Ant Bat Cat Dog Emu" when /doevents is called it will trigger the sub event\_stuff.

/doevents will process all your events since the last time it was done If the event happened 5 times since the last /doevents then it will execute your sub 5 times

It needs to be exact, nothing in front or behind of your string. If you received a tell it would not trigger as there are ' '.

### Multiple events calling same sub

You can have multiple triggers if you use the same event\_name with different strings it will trigger. Because everything in the example is \#event stuff it will trigger the sub each time it sees it

### Using wildcard

You can use wildcards via \#\*\#

`#event stuff "Ant #*# Cat"`

This would trigger with **/echo Ant Bird Cat**

**/echo Ant Bird Cat Dog** Would not trigger because there is no wildcard after Cat

`#event stuff "Ant #*# Cat #*#"`

This would trigger for **/echo Ant Bird Cat** and **/echo Ant Bird Cat Dog**

### Using parsed datatypes

In the string for event\_name you can use datatypes with \|${DataType}\|

`#event stuff "|${Me.Name}| is cool"`

Assuming your in game name is LamahHerder... This would call sub event\_stuff if **/echo LamahHerder is cool**

### Passing a variable

In the string for event\_name you can use \#int\# to pass a variable to the event\_name sub

```text
#event stuff "Quick #1# this #2#"

sub event_stuff(Line, word1, word2, word3, word4)
   /echo ${word1}, ${word2}
/return
```

For **/echo Quick burn this ${Target}**

This would have ${word1}=burn and ${word2}=*Your Target* as a local string variable in sub event\_stuff
