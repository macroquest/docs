# /caption

## Syntax

**/caption list \| type** _**value**_ **\| update \# \| MQCaptions [ on \| off ]**

## Description

Sets the custom captions from in-game. Using this command will also change the ini settings for the particular level.

EQ itself constantly updates the name of every spawn in the zone, even though only a small portion of those are displayed. Using /caption allows you to modify how many spawn captions updated. The default setting for /caption update is 35.

Player1 through Player4 in MacroQuest.ini are directly related to which /shownames level you use.

```text
Player1 is linked to /shownames 1
Player2 is linked to /shownames 2
Player3 is linked to /shownames 3
Player4 is linked to /shownames 4
```

## Examples

```text
Player1=${If[${NamingSpawn.Trader},Trader,]}${If[${NamingSpawn.Invis},(${NamingSpawn.DisplayName})
```

* Use "\n" to add a new line when setting captions
* To use the default (EQ settings\) clear the specific setting\(Player1-Player4) in the ini using:

  ```text
  /caption Player1
  ```

* You can also configure Player1 - Player4 from the EQ client using:

  ```text
  /caption Player# configsettings
  ```

\*Sets the number of nearest spawns for MQ2 to update the name of each pass to 20. By default, this is 35.

\*:

```text
/caption update 20
```

\*When using MQCaption if no parameter is given, the default parameter is off

* Look at the Macroquest.ini file in the zip file under [Captions] for examples of configuring Player1-Player4.
