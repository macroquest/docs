# /next

## Syntax

**/for** _**varname** initial-value_ **to\|downto** final-value **[step** _interval_**]**

**/next** _**varname**_

## Description

This runs all commands between the /for line and the /next line, after which it increments/decrements the _varname_ number (\#1\) by _step_ number (\#3) \(default is 1) before running through the commands again. It will keep doing this until the _varname_ number equals \#2. You can end a /for loop immediately with /break or try the next iteration with /continue.
