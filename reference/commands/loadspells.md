# /loadspells

## Syntax
```eqcommand
/loadspells [list|<"name">]
```

## Description
Loads or lists saved spell sets. Similar to /memspellset, but it only memorizes the spellset if it's not already memorized. This command was part of MQ years before EQ was inspired to add /memspellset.

## Parameters

- **/loadspells list** - Shows all saved spell sets with their index numbers
- **/loadspells "name"** - Loads a spell set by exact name match (case insensitive)
