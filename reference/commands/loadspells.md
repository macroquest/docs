# /loadspells

**/loadspells** _spellset_

Loads the specified spellset.

This is the same as the EQ command /memspellset, with the addition that it only memorizes the spellset if it is not already memorized. This command was part of MQ2 long before EQ added the same functionality.

**/loadspells list**

Lists all of your saved spellsets.

**/loadspells list** _**spellset**_

List the spells in the specified spellset.
