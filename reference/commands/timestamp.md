# /timestamp

## Syntax

**/timestamp**

## Description

* Is a toggle, can be set in MacroQuest.ini TimeStampChat=0 in the [MacroQuest] section.
* Basically it timestamps all chat when its on...

`NOTE: The timestamp takes place AFTER chatevents are handled, so at least in theory`

this should NOT have any adverse effects when turned on.
