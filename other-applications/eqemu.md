# EQEmu

## General

EQEmu \(or EQEmulator\) is a free \(under GNU GPL\) open source EverQuest server emulator. Using EQEmu you can create and run your own EverQuest server, or play on servers other people have created. Some servers play exactly like EQLive, while others have custom content such as zones, NPCs, equipment, allowing players to do what they want, or giving them access to GM commands. 

### Use with MQ

Currently, MQ **does not** have a standard build for EQEmu servers, but the work is on the schedule and will be coming soon.
