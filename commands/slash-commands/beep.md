# Beep

## Syntax

**/beep** \[ _filename_ \]

## Description

Invokes a system beep \(beep from the built-in PC speaker\).

Adding _filename_ will play a .wav file located in your Everquest directory. This function uses the In-game sound so while a normal /beep will sound if you have EQ muted, this will not.

If you prefer you can play the sounds in the Everquest "sounds" directory by using something like

/beep sounds/_filename_
