# /whotarget

## Syntax

**/whotarget**

## Description

MQ2 enhances this EQ command by allowing you to use it on any target (including NPCs\). Output is the same as the /who command \(set by /whofilter), displaying the target's class, race, level, guild, con color, and distance regardless of the player being in anonymous or roleplaying mode.
