## Syntax

**<span style="color:red">/whotarget</span>**

## Description

MQ2 enhances this EQ command by allowing you to use it on any target (including NPCs). Output is the same as the /who
command (set by /whofilter), displaying the target's class, race, level, guild, con color, and distance regardless of
the player being in anonymous or roleplaying mode.
