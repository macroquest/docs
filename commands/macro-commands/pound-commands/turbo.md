# \#turbo

## Description

\#turbo \#\#\#

This will prevent bad macros from locking up the client by allowing you to limit the number of commands per iteration.

## Use

The default is 10, while the maximum value is 120.

A value of 1 will essentially disable \#turbo.

**\#turbo** is active with the default of 10 in all macros even if you do not use \#turbo in your macro. Setting \#turbo to 0 will set the value to 20.

## Example

```text
#turbo 120
```
