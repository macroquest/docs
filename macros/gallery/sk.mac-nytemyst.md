## Description

This macro is mainly for high level shadow knights, but possible for low levels to use. this macro is designed with the toon having the ROF Expansion. This macro is not meant to go out and pull but instead more like "guard" the camp that you're currently at. Will attempt to use aggro spells and range items to aggro mobs from a distance that you have set.

## Required Plugins

* [MQ2Exchange](https://macroquest2.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?t=16436)
* [MQ2MoveUtils](https://macroquest2.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?t=11732)
* [MQ2Melee](https://macroquest2.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?t=12779) This one is optional and not really needed but

  the macro will not do little things like bash,or put pet on hold. You will need to turn off all stick settings on

  the plugin as they will interfere with the macro.

  cast items in bags without having the bag opened.

## Ini Samples

`NameList`
`[Discord_raid]`
`Name=|Pallorax the soul slayer|a gelidran rift slave|a pyrilen rift slave|Venom Lord Ksathrax|Mindshear Acolyte|Venomous projection|a venom protector|Mindshear Avatar|`

`MezzImmuneList`
`[korascian_raid]`
`MezzImmune=|a crystalline nexiont|`

`IgnoreList`
`[Oldcommons]`
`Exclude=|Peron ThreadSpinner|Innkeep Dolman|Innkeep Olissa|Innkeep Redthorn|`

Tip for adding mobs into this list without manually into the INI. Create a hotkey like so.

`/named ${Target.CleanName}`
`/exclude ${Target.CleanName}`
`/mezzimmune ${Target.CleanName}`

This allows you to add to those lists for any mob you're target while the macro is running.

-Note No spell below requires you to put in the Ranks unless it's mentioned to do so. With the exception of buffs no spell is membed before hand. You must have it already memed if you want to use it.

## Bot Flow

After starting the macro if you do not have Aggro turned on or dps mode turned on it will just buff itself. If you have aggro on it's first going to look for mobs in a 50 radius range. It will automatically choose a name,mezzimmune, or the lowest HP mob within that radius.

If there are no mobs in a 50 range radius then the macro will check if it has rez affects on. If so the macro will just buff itself and not try to aggro anything beyond the 50 radius. For mobs beyond the 50 radius it will look for mobs at a distance you set under "Mobradius". It will grab the highest level ,Named,mezzimmune mob and work it's way down.

Macro does the initial aggro in 2 ways and both will be attempted to use. Will try to cast the first hate spell you have set in the ini and will try to use any range item like bow and arrow. If a mob goes into camp before you pulled enters camp it will switch to mob that's in camp. If the mob takes more then 20 seconds the camp the macro will clear the target, ignore that mob from pulling for 60 seconds and look for something else. If that mob eventually makes it into camp it will aggro the mob whether the timer is up or not.

Once mob in camp it will stick to the mob. Use numerous Discs and spells such as demand for power,withstand,bite aa. Will constantly monitor health and will do lifetaps to keep it's self up. Will also nuke and dot. If it encounters a name it will using all tanking disciplines as well as dps disciples that stack with the tanking ones. Will use AA snare on any mobs that are trying to flee. Will keep any Skin or steely stance buffs up during combat.

If more then one mop is in camp it will use ae aggro. If more then 3 mobs in camp and the health drops to low it will attempt to use deflection disc.
