`This macro offers:`  
`Intelligent Healing Code`  
`Spell Gem Optimization`  
`Dynamic Mana Preservation`  
`Mob Debuffing(Malo/Slow/Cripple/Root/Nuke/Dot)`

`Pet Routines`

## How To Use

To use this macro, you must have these files in your macros directory: DRShmbot.mac dREvents.inc dRSubs.inc

To start the macro, type: /mac DRShmbot.mac \_\_

Tank Name and Master Name are optional. They are **NOT** required but must be set in the INI for the bot to function correctly if not provided.

The macro will create an INI file for you to customize called, dR\_ToonsName.ini, in your macro directory. (Ex. dR\_Bobshaman.ini)

After the INI file is created, it will end the macro and you **MUST** edit the new INI file. Then you can restart the macro\(You will not need to edit it after it has been set once unless you need to change a setting.

This macro **DOES NOT REQUIRE ANY PLUGIN** but it will use MQ2EQBC if you want it to. However, there is no support for it on this macro at this time.

## Commands and Aliases

None at this time.

## Dynamic Mana

More to be posted later.

## Spell Gem Optimization

Add to your macro before main loop:

`/declare numGem int outer`  
`/declare OWgem int outer`  
`/call GemOpt`

#### Subs for use within macro

_/call GemMem ${SpellGem} ${SpellName} ${SpellGemState} ${MOWState}_

`ex. /call GemMem ${NukeGem} ${Nuke} ${NukeStatus} TRUE`  
`/call GemMem 4 "Ice Spear of Solist" TRUE FALSE`  
`/call GemMem 0 "Complete Healing" FALSE ${CHAlwaysOW}`  
`/call GemMem 9 "Ancient: Hallowed Light" ${KeepAH} ${AHOverWrite}`

* SpellNameHere must be a string, SpellGemHere must be a integer, SpellGemState must be TRUE/FALSE
  * FALSE means that the spell will stay until a spell is memmed over top of it within the macro by the user or

    manually deleted.

  * TRUE flags the gem as switchable. Spells will be memmed to the least used switchable slot
* SpellGemHere
  * when it equals 0, means that the sub will memorize into the first switchable gem it finds that is available.
  * If no gems are available, it finds the switchable gem that has not been cast in the longest time
  * Each timer for each switchable gem is set to a default of five minutes. Lowest timer will be overwritten, or

    first in list if multiple timers are at 0
* MOWState is just a TRUE/FALSE constant that tells the sub to overwrite it if no gems can be switched and you don't

  want to use the OWgem

**IF you want the timer function to work correctly, you must add this line directly after casts in your macro**

`/if (${Macro.Return.Equal[CAST_SUCCESS]}) /call GemTimer ${Me.Gem[<${SpellThatWasCast}>]}`

_/call GemEdit ${SpellName - OR - SpellGem}_

`ex. /if (${SpGem[1,2]}) /call GemEdit 1`  
`/call GemEdit "Complete Healing"`  
`/call GemEdit ${QuickHeal}`  
`/if (${Nuke.Equal[${SpGem[${NukeGem},1]}]}) /call GemEdit ${NukeGem}`

* This sub is used to switch states of memorized spells or spell gems. IF the spell name isnt found, no change will

  occur. This state will be changed next time a gem will be memorized, therefore no need to mindlessly call GemFind
