# AutoBot.mac-V4.28+

## Description

[AutoBot.mac](https://macroquest2.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?t=12712) by A\_Druid\_00 is a versatile macro for automating a lot of tasks for your character in group, raid and solo situations.

This wiki includes many updates/changes done by Gomer,gSe7eN,trevyn,Warlock45,and others.

## Requirements

[AutoBot.mac](https://macroquest2.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?t=12712) does not run on a default MQ compilation, it has a few extra dependencies. Some of the below items are plugins and need to be compiled, just like MacroQuest2. Please read the appropriate documentation for each plugin. The Include files should be added to the same directory that AutoBot will be run from.

Plugins:

* [MQ2MoveUtils](https://macroquest2.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?t=11732) by Outlander

  This is so the macro knows about stick, /makecamp, and /moveto. Check out the

  [wiki](https://macroquest.org/wiki/index.php/MQ2MoveUtils).

* [MQ2Exchange](https://macroquest2.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?t=7603) by Wassup

  This is so that item swapping, casting, and swapping back will work

* [MQ2Debuffs](https://macroquest2.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?t=13495) by pinkfloydx33

  This is so the macro can keep track of your debuff counters.

* [MQ2Melee](https://macroquest2.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?t=12779) by s0rcier

  So as to properly configure melee/ranged combat and various options thereof, check out the

  [wiki](https://macroquest.org/wiki/index.php/MQ2Melee).

  \*Optional: [MQ2AutoLogin](https://macroquest2.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=50&t=16427&hilit=MQ2Autologin)

  to change to your trader

Includes Files:

* [Wait4Rez.inc](wait4rez.inc.md) Handles pre-rez situations.
* [spell\_routines.inc](spell-routines.inc.md) Handles spell casting, from gems, items and AAs.
* QuickBeg2.inc Handles buff begging.
* [Ninjadvloot.inc](ninjadvloot.inc.md) Handles looting.
* [Defense.inc](defense.inc.md) Handles automatic engagement of defensive disc/aa/items for tanks.
* [AAPurchase.incHandles](aapurchase.inc.md) automatic purchase of AA based on INI entries.

## Getting Started

Pointers for AutoBot stuffs. (We should make a multi-boxing wiki sometime, we could link it here...)

In addition to the documentation for the various plugins used directly by AutoBot (see links in [Requirements](https://macroquest.org/wiki/index.php/AutoBot.mac#Requirements)) The following is useful info on other plugins you can use to enhance your AutoBot experience.

[MQ2Clip](https://macroquest2.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?t=7692) by Vaft, Cr4zyb4rd, et al.
Manages the clip plane of backgrounded sessions. Your CPU will thank you.

[MQ2FPS](https://macroquest2.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?t=8346) by Lax.
Helps manage framerates of EQ sessions, greatly helps multi-botting... Check out the [wiki](https://macroquest.org/wiki/index.php/MQ2FPS)

[MQ2Eqbc](https://macroquest2.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?t=12147) by Omnictrl
Is an alternative way to communicate with your bots.
Configure your EQBC.ini with the following:
[Last Connect]
Server=192.168.1.101 (This must be edited to match the ip and port you have the server listening to)
Port=2112
[Settings]
AutoConnect=1
AllowControl=1

You will also need to change the channel setting in your AutoBot.ini from "i say" to "bc" to use it for bot to bot communication. Don't forget that if you are getting identify spam that you check loot.ini and QB2Settings.ini for any i say or i msg commands. QB2Settings.ini defaults to i msg and needs to be changed if using EQBC. Recommend [MQ2NetBots](https://macroquest2.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?t=12186), [MQ2NetStat](https://macroquest2.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?t=12186), and [MQ2NetHeal](https://macroquest2.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?t=12312&highlight=mq2netheal) to go along with this. More information available on [Page 59](https://macroquest2.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?t=11619&postdays=0&postorder=asc&highlight=eqbc+autobot&start=870) of the original AutoBot thread.

## Using AutoBot.mac

1\) The main macro file, 'yyy.mac' (called 'RaidDruid.mac' in the .zip file) can be named to 'AutoBot.mac' or 'AnythingYouWant.mac'.
2\) To start the macro in EverQuest with MQ2 running; type '/macro yyy.mac
Note: The first time you run the macro, it will generate an ini file called RD\_xxx.ini
3\) Configure your RD\_xxx.ini, where 'xxx' is your character name.
3a\) Peruse through [RDCommon.ini](rdcommon.ini.md) and add in any mobs you might want to have certains spells ignore. I tend to put Guild Lobby and PoK NPCs as immune to mez, makes life simpler when walking around and I forget to pause my bots. You will also find the MasterList here.
4\)Restart Autobot after configuring RD\_xxx.ini.
5\) Enjoy the show.

## Bot Commands

There are a few non-alias (no / required) commands available to Autobot. These commands will cause the bots to respond to a few general status/movement commands without the obvious /alias, for easy use in a group setting. Bots will only respond to commands sent by someone in the MasterList
**buffqueue**
This command has your bot respond in your ChatChannel with the \# of buffs left in his "buff queue". Handy for deciding whether to continue pulling/crawling after a group wipe. Keep in mind that some longer cast spells such as Night's Dark Terror for enchanters have extremely long recast times, and so can sit in the queue for a while.
**break**
This will make your bots visible (they will click off all invisibility or IVU buffs).
**camp here**
This command will cause any other toons using Autobot to utilize MQ2Moveutil's "make camp" function, using he location coordinates you are standing on when issuing the command.
**follow**
This command will have your bots /stick to you. They will sit to med if needed and within your LeashLength. They will also break off to attack if /domelee is turned on and the MA is fighting something. They will also service buff requests and do debuffing if applicable and they are not moving.
**guard here**
Those toons you have the Guard function turned on will utilize MQ2MoveUtils camp function to set up a tightly controlled camp radius where that character is currently standing.
**mana**
All bots with a mana pool bigger than 0 will report their current % mana in your /chatchannel.
**medtime**
All bots with a mana pool bigger than 0 will report their currently estimated time to full mana based on their current Mana Regen divided by their mana level.
**move up**
This command tells your bots to move up to your current location. If they are set to /makecamp, they will reset their camp X and Y loc to your current position. If they are following, they will resume following once they reach your position (This is handy for positioning your bots in front of doors/bridges before moving through/across them)
**stop**
This command tells the bots to stop following wherever they happen to be standing.
**use keyword XXX YYY**
This command will cause the toon to say the keyword XXX to target YYY. Example: "use keyword when gribble"
**who has XXXX**
This command will have the toon check their inventory for the item. It will announce in the chat channel if it is in your bank, bags, top level inventory, or a worn item. If the item is an augment and mounted, it will say what item the augments is in.

**Send me to XXXXX**
This will cause a listening wizard or druid to cast zehphyr/translocate XXX on the requester, uses same keywords as portto
**portto XXXXX**
This will cause your wizard or druid bot to port using their group port spells, provided they have them in their spellbook. Current accepted keywords are:

## Slash Commands

[AutoBot.mac](https://macroquest2.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?t=11619) comes with a great set of predefined [Slash Commands](../../reference/commands/) for easy and fast in-game configuration.
Uber macro pause/unpause hotkey (bound to  for me, unlike normal EQ hotkeys 1-10, it works even while casting) Add the following lines to [MQ2CustomBinds](https://macroquest.org/wiki/index.php/MQ2CustomBinds).txt:

`name=StartPauseDB`
`down=/docommand ${If[!${Macro.Name.Equal[RaidDruid.mac]}, /mac RaidDruid.mac, /varset RDPause ${If[${RDPause}==1,0,1]}]}`
`up=`

Then in game type _/bind StartPauseDB \_ to bind that to your _\_ key. When pressed your _\_ key will start AutoBot if it's not already started. If it's already running it will toggle the pause on the macro.

Here's a full list, divided into sub-sections for each category of [Slash Commands](../../reference/commands/) there are (Each toggle alias works by itself, or will take an argument of ON/OFF, TRUE/FALSE, or 1/0):

  or AE Damage effects.

  Sets the % you start Chealing. Due to some predictive logic the Cheal may start earlier. Set this to the abslute

  floor you want to start CH at.

* **/usech**

  Toggles using your Cheal spell on MA1 on or off. It will monitor the tank's HPs and if he's taking enough damage to

  be dead in less than 20 seconds, it will duck out of whatever RD is currently doing and start a CH. If the tank's

  HPs stop falling and level off above the TankHealPct, it will cancel CH and wait until the tank's HPs fall again.

* **/usedelayed**

  Toggles casting the listed Delayed Heal on MA1

  Toggle. When turned on, this will wait until your heals have less than .5 seconds left before making the decison to

  cancel the heal.

### Buffing

AutoBot queues buff requests and casts them when appropriate. It will not cast buffs unless there are no mobs within 20 feet of the bot, it's not in combat, and it's not moving. It will hold onto those buff requests until you are no longer moving, not in combat, and there are no mobs within 20 feet. If you zone, all stored buffs are flushed, and you have to beg again.
By default the bot only listens for /tells and IRC chat for buffing. If you want him to listen in other channels, you need to add **\#chat group** to listen in group, or **\#chat chat** to listen in EQ's chat channels; to the RaidDruid.mac file under the **\#chat tell** line right near the top of the macro. More information on the \#chat function can be found in the MacroQuest [manual](https://macroquest.org/includes/wassup/manual.php).

**Aliases:**

* **/buff "Spell Name/Alias" [Name \| Group]**

  Use this alias to send a buff command to your bot, will also accept buff aliases. You can use this to cast items and

  AAs as well as spells. If you specify Group instead of a name, it will buff your whole group with that spell, if it

  is a single target spell. In addition, you can cast it on any spawn including NPCs, Pets, Corpses, etc. \(Ex. /buff

  "Steeloak Skin"� Bob, or /buff Oak Bob if oak is an alias for steeloak skin\). If the /buff command utilizes a DoBuff

  alias, the buff request is queued and will not be performed during combat. If the Spell/AA/item name itself is used

  in the /buff command it is cast immediately. \(Ex. /buff "Exodus" would fire right away, while /buff "Evac" would

  not\). \*\*WARNING: YOUR BOTS WILL NOT WATCH THE GROUP'S HPS OR ANYTHING ELSE WHILE EXECUTING A /BUFF COMMAND, USE IT

  WHEN YOU KNOW YOU DON'T NEED TO BE DOING ANYTHING ELSE IMPORTANT LIKE HEALING\*\*

* **/dobuffs**

  Toggles automatic casting of buff requests made via /tell

* **/dobufftells**

  Toggles sending automatic replies to buff requests made via /tell

* **/selfbuff**

  Toggles Self Buffing. Useful if you happen to be in an environment where having all your self buffs up puts you over

  the limit

* **/wow**

  Toggles automatic casting of Wrath of the Wild on your designated MA. I figure an extra 650 damage every 4 minutes

  cant hurt, since its mana free and all.

### Debuffing

* **/debuffchannel**

  from.

### Curing

## Troubleshooting/FAQ

* **On "where is my master list?!?**

The master list was moved to the RDCommon.ini file to avoid having to maintain a list on 50 different profile ini's. Open RDCommon.ini and use find "MastereList" to easily find where to put additional names.

`(A new command was added, in the channel your toon is listening to send "add to masterlist newtoonname" to have the macro add the new name to the list)`

* **On I set my ini to service XXXX skill/spell/AA/item but its not working**

Got something spelled wrong or not filled out properly. Check the examples again. Very rarely EQ has odd spaces in some names. I find it best to look up the spell/skill/item/AA off of Allakhazam.com and copy+paste to insure accurate spelling when troubleshooting problem INI's.

* **On Dots/Debuffs that don't work, but (possibly) used to**

If in a group/raid with HoTT leadership skill set UseHoTT=1 in the ini file. If HoTT is not avialable you must set UseHoTT=0. Check to see the MaxMobs=5 is appropraite to the number of NPC's around you. Monsters that are green or sitting/laying down will never be debuffed/dotted.

* **On Buff requests not being serviced**

Unless you indicate that you want the buff executed in combat the bot will not service the buff if there are NPC's nearby. You can have the macro ignore certain npcs that we know for certain arnt kos by adding their names in the RDCommon.ini .Alternatly the NPC check radius is adjustable in the ini. Also make sure that the buff name is spelled correctly just how it looks in the info window. Lastly make sure that the alias's are correct. in the example ini's it looks like this "\| convicton \| viction \| convic \|", however if you have it set up like that, the buff requester for all intents and purposes needs to put that word in a sentence. if you have the ini looking like this "\|convicton\|viction\|convic\|" with no spaces in between the " \| " then the bot will reconize and ackowlege any tell that has any of the word alias's it sees.

* **On Bot will assist but wont engage when set to**

The bigest thing you do to fix that is increase the NPCRadius=120, Also, consider verifiying, and tweaking the following as well. NPCZRadius=120, AssistMA=TRUE, , DoMelee=TRUE, AssistDelay=0s, MA1=Chuck\_Norris, EngageHPs=101. aso remember that other options may be fighting for servicing. looting, selfbuffing, debuffing, buffing, etc.. so if melee is priority, turn everything but assisting off. also make sure that mq2melee is set up right. type /melee to bring up its console and see whats set and whats not. same thing goes. if your not a pet class turn off all that other stuff to prevent any chance of conflicts.

* **On Cant load selo's into the ini**

Selos uses a "\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`" located to the left of the 1 key.

* **On incorrectly mezed Targets (also known as: Oh why does my chanter mez my MA's target?)**

You need to properly set the target for the BOT by the Leader AA, or /varset MATarget ${Target.ID} as explained in "On target acquisition"

* **On automatically mezzing NPCs when you don't want to**

Set /rdpause on the BOT you want to stop auto debuffing (rdpause stops all automatic activity\), type "/rdpause on" \(minus quotes\) into your command channel to stop auto-activity on multiple BOT's at once, or add the NPC you wish to not mez to the immune/ignore list in RDCommon.ini. You will need to know the spell ID for the spell you wish not to cast and this can be found by ${Spell[My Mez Spell Name Here\].ID} \(Use /echo in front of ${Spell\[My Mez Spell Name Here].ID} if your typing it in EQ)

* **On Target acquisition**

AutoBot acquires the Main Assist's (MA) target in a number of ways.

1\) By setting the MA in the bot's ini file and the assist delay, the macro will attempt to acquire the target of the MA after the set time.

2\) By assigning the role Main Assist to someone in your group, the bot will acquire the MA's target that way. (if /udegroupassist or /usegroupma is on)

3\) By assigning the role Main Tank to someone in your group, the bot will aquire the MT's target. (if /usegrouptank is on)

4\) By manually setting the MA's target using /varset MATarget ${Target.ID} in whatever channel your bots listen to commands in.

5\) By using "/useraidassist" or "/useraidma" (remember to turn off /usegroupma and /usegrouptank if you do this\) the macro will aquire a target assist the raids main assist \(Raid Assist 1)

* **On non-working clickies**

If you have a clicky with no recast timer that isn't working. (Such as Time's Antithesis, Veil of Lost Hopes, et al...\) The odds are you have an old version of MQ2. As of the 20th of Dec Zip, these issues have been fixed. if you don't know what version of the zip you have, try simply running /echo ${FindItem[item name].Timer} and seeing what value it returns. Anything other than zero is Bad\(tm) and denotes an out-of-date zip file. Update, update, update! Also your last inventory slot must NOT be a bag. Clickies usable from inventory, even if usable in other slots, will be used from base inventory slot 8.

* **On chain-casting clickies or buffs**

Often times this is due to misspelling something in the INI file, or it can be the resulting buff icon differs from the spell icon in some manner. You will note there is now an "Icon" entry for buffs. Carefully double check the actual name of the buff ingame and match the INI to it.

* **On out-of-date alias lists**

If you are attempting to reload your alias to your macroquest.ini. You must remove the Version=X.XX from RD\_common.ini. Doing this will make the Version mismatch appear and reload all the alias's

* **On healing not working**
* **On heals that never cancel even though target's health goes above CancelPct**

Tankheal must be defined as a valid spell and different than FastHeal=, even if you are not using Tankheals (UseCH setting).

* **On Green (non-XP) corpses that are not auto looted**

These are not looted automatically. To trigger looting, at any time, send your bot "You gain party experience!" in whatever channel it is set to monitor.

* **On late/not reliable buffs**

Bots will not buff in combat. Also it will not sit to memorize buffs if a NPC is within a certain range, although using a horse remedies this.

* **On non-refreshing buffs on bots themselves**

Buffs from the [DoBuffStuff\] or buff command are not rebuffed on the same bot that cast them, because you dont get a buff wear off message when they wear off yourself. If you want certain buffs kept up on your bot, you should use \[SelfBuffStuff] section.

* **On bots that keep targeting some npc, even though it hasn't been told it to assist and kill it**

Your MA could have a corpse close, and that is being assisted to get a target. Or you could be using an old version of autobot.

* **On non-following bots**

Target someone and type /stick. If that doesnt work you have issues with [MQ2MoveUtils](https://macroquest2.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?t=11732).

* **On Clerics that spam Complete Heals and interrupt them all**

Make sure you have UseDivArb set to 0 if you dont have that AA. // There's more to this than just the DivArb setting... but this might be one issue\

* **On non-attacking pets/bots**

Check your MQ2Melee settings(the wiki for it is [here](https://macroquest.org/wiki/index.php/MQ2Melee)). You need a properly configured MQ2Melee for your pets/bots to attack and do other various melee-related tasks.

* **On items being identified**

You aren't using the IRC plugin. By default /i is mapped to /identify.

* **No slash commands work or error: "DoCommand - Couldn't parse '/...' "**

This usually happens when you update MQ2 and overwrite the macroquest.ini file. This file contains all the aliases (ie. the slash commands). To fix, delete the Version=X.XX line in RD\_Common.ini, which will write all the aliases back to the macroquest.ini file when you restart Autobot. In general, you do not need to overwrite the Macroquest.ini file when updating MQ2.

* **When your bot doesn't mem spells**

Your ini is set up wrong. Your XXXXGem\#= entry needs to read "gem\#", not just \#. At least, 9 times out of 10 that's the problem. Check one of the sample ini files for an example.

* **On My bots dont aquire targets when everything is set up properly**

Each toon needs a breastplate, it has to do with the way autobot checks deaths and runs the auto accept rez feature, it also disables assisting, for a good reason...
