# Group Language Trainer

This macro was originally published in the Macro Depot 3.0 Forum, and has been successfully used to max out languages.

The speed at which languages are learned is dependent on either intelligence or wisdom, depending on class. The higher the stat, the quicker it goes up. A typical character will max all languages in about 3 passes.

**Instructions**

Paste this code into a file called lang.mac in your **\macros** directory.

In game, create a social with 5 lines of text, and place this in hotbutton 1. It doesn't matter what it says, as this macro will only end up spamming numbers anyway. While spamming, group members can either turn off group text in options, or can use /ignore [spammer] during the "lesson".
