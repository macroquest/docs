# Introduction

Genbot was released by GrimJack sometime in early 2003 and eventually became one of the more
popular bot macros. Genbot was originally designed as a core set of scripts to handle all of the non class specific
functions needed in a bot while providing a means to easily "plug in" any extra code needed for a specific character.

Genbot History  

-   Version 0 - 8.8 Genbot created and developed by GrimJack
-   Version 8.8 - ? GrimJack stopped playing [everquest](http://www.everquest.com) and
    Lasher took over the code.
-   Version ? - 12.34 Lord Giddeon maintained the code.
-   Version 12.35 - 13.3 Vexix took over the code.

## Known Issues

When using MQ2IRC in combination with the Genbot macro be sure to NOT use the /gb sitaftercast command.  
I do not know how but issuing this command with either off/on makes it so  
genbot chat no longer goes to the IRC window. Without this command the plugin  
and macro work together perfectly.
