Requires this VSCode extension. MQ definitions IMGUI definitions I won't cover language conventions or features, just mention that mq2lua is built on LuaJIT 2.0.5 if you need to know the specific flavor. Command Reference \u00b6 /lua [COMMAND] {OPTIONS} MQ2Lua: A lua script binding plugin. run -- run lua script from file location parse -- parse a lua string with an available mq namespace stop -- stop one or all running lua scripts pause -- pause one or all running lua scripts conf -- set or view configuration variable reloadconf -- reload configuration ps -- ps-like process listing info -- info for a process -h, -?, help -- displays this help text run the first argument is a script name (.lua is optional) additional arguments will be passed as arguments to the script parse all arguments will be interpreted as a lua script (via loadstring ) the mq namespace is provided for you (as mq ) stop no argument will stop all running scripts will accept script name or PID as an argument to stop individual scripts pause no argument will attempt to pause or resume all running scripts if all scripts are paused or resumed, will toggle state on all of them otherwise, will just pause any running scripts will accept script name or PID as an argument to pause or resume individual scripts conf arguments are option and value if only option is specified, will just echo the value reloadconf just reloads the config after it has been edited ps provides a table of processes with a quick status takes a list of statuses to filter the list ( STARTING , RUNNING , PAUSED , EXITED ) defaults to listing RUNNING and PAUSED scripts info displays detailed information about the status of a script takes a PID or a script name defaults to an unfiltered ps list when no script is specified TLO & Datatypes \u00b6 One new TLO is provided, Lua . This is a transparent accessor to the new lua datatype, and takes no index because it is a global state. The new datatypes (and their members) are as follows: lua PIDs (string) - a comma-delimited list of integer PIDs that have info to access Dir (string) - the base lua scripts directory Turbo (int) - the turbo value RequirePaths (string) - the semicolon-delimited value for lua require search paths CRequirePaths (string) - the semicolon-delimited value for dll require search paths Script (luainfo) - the accessor to get info on individual scripts. Accepts a PID as an index, or will default to the last executed script that has finished running. luainfo (accessed using the Script accessor above) PID (int)- the PID of the running or most recently executed version of this script Name (string) - the name of the script Path (string) - the full path of the script Arguments (string) - a comma delimited list of arguments passed to the script StartTime (string) - The time the most recent execution of the script was started EndTime (string) - The time the most recent execution of the script ended or NULL if the script has not ended ReturnCount (int) - The number of returns from the script, will be 0 if the script has not ended Return (string) - if not indexed, a comma-delimited list of return values. Accepts an integer index to get a single return value if there is more than one Status (string) - The execution status of the script First Script Step \u00b6 The first thing to do when writing a lua script for MQ2 is to require('mq') . The 'mq' package is built into the plugin and is what provides access to all of the lua-mq bridge bindings. Everything that binds lua to mq is going to be accessed like mq.something , with one exception. The single exception is that the built-in lua function print() has been redirected to write to the mq chat. Special functions provided at the base level are: print('string') as noted before mq.delay(val, --[[optional]]callback) where val can be an integer (which denotes milliseconds of delay) or a string that ends in 's' 'm' or 'ms' to have delays with human readable durations. The callback is optinal and is a function which evaluates to true or false to decide whether to end the delay early. mq.join(args...) where args must be convertible to string inside lua. This will join all the arguments into a single string mq.exit() force exits the script, ignoring the normal lua return flow mq.bind('/command', callback) where the callback is a lua function to execute when the user enters /command mq.unbind('/command') un-binds the command so that it will no longer function mq.event('name', 'matcher text', callback) where the callback is a lua function to execute when the text matching the matcher is detected mq.unevent('name') unregisters the event 'name' so that it won't react to the text anymore mq.doevents(optional 'event') will process queued events (binds don't queue, they execute automatically, this is only for events). No arguments will process all events in the queue, and optionally you can pass in a single event that you wish to process and all other events will remain queued(but not flushed). mq.flushevents(optional 'event') clears all events in the queue without processing them. No arguments will flush all events in the queue, and optionally you can pass in a single event that you wish to flush. mq.parse(string) runs the string through the macro parser and returns the result as a string (regardles of the data type returned). This is not a replacement for mq.TLO or mq.TLO.MacroVariable and is only for complex operations where neither of those will work (generally converting from old ini/macro formats) mq.TLO noted in TLO Bindings below mq.cmd and mq.cmdf noted in Command Bindings below mq.imgui noted in ImGui Bindings below Lua Bindings \u00b6 TLO Bindings \u00b6 TLOs are the same as macro TLOs, just accessed via the lua API. The reason for exposing these is to allow a quick conversion from macros directly into lua. The quick rules to convert are as follows: Remove the ${} prepend the expression with mq.TLO. replace all [] with () wrap all strings with quotes (double or single, it doesn't matter) append () to the end to finally bring the result into lua For example, let's take the macro data value of ${Me.Buff[Spirit of Wolf].ID} . To convert this into lua following the steps, you get this: Me.Buff[Spirit of Wolf].ID mq.TLO.Me.Buff[Spirit of Wolf].ID mq.TLO.Me.Buff(Spirit of Wolf).ID mq.TLO.Me.Buff('Spirit of Wolf').ID mq.TLO.Me.Buff('Spirit of Wolf').ID() Something in particular to note. While things like mq.TLO.Math and mq.TLO.SomeString.Equals will work, it would be much better if you just bring those types into lua and do lua operations on them. so do mq.TLO.SomeString() == 'thatstring' or instead of mq.TLO.Math('1 + 1') just do 1 + 1 . Take advantage of the medium! Command Bindings \u00b6 This binding allows you to pass commands to EQ. It is very dumb in that it can take any value, and will just prepend a / in front of it and send it to the EQ parser. Any arguments passed to it are stringified (in lua), concatenated (with a space delimiter), and sent as part of the command. So for instance, mq.cmd('/who all fred') will end up getting passed to EQ as /who all fred . You can also use cmdf to provide a format string: mq.cmdf('/who all %s', someStringValue) ImGui Bindings \u00b6 ImGui is a feature that lua supports that has no equivalent in the macro world. For full documentation of the source binding API, this page has the source: sol2 ImGui Bindings . As mq may have different needs, we can expand this as time goes on, and if that happens, then we will add a page on this wiki to document all the available bindings. To use imgui, you must register a callback using mq.imgui.init('name', callback) . The callback will be a function that will be called every imgui update, and will usually be the code to render your imgui windows. To remove the callback, you can use mq.imgui.destroy('name') and the callback will unregister and no longer render on imgui updates. Additional Bindings \u00b6 In addition to the full set of binds in the MSeys repo, we have also added the following: Drag and drop support \u00b6 -- ImGui.BeginDragDropSource(...) -- Parameters: int (flags) [O] -- Returns: bool (isDragged) -- Overloads isDragged = ImGui . BeginDragDropSource () isDragged = ImGui . BeginDragDropSource ( ImGuiDragDropFlags . SourceNoPreviewTooltip ) -- ImGui.EndDragDropSource() ImGui . EndDragDropSource () -- ImGui.BeginDragDropTarget() -- Returns: bool (isDropped) isDropped = ImGui . BeginDragDropTarget () -- ImGui.EndDragDropTarget() ImGui . EndDragDropTarget () -- ImGui.SetDragDropPayload(...) -- Parameters: text (type), object(data), int (cond) [O] -- Returns: bool -- Overloads ImGui . SetDragDropPayload ( 'ITEMN' , i ) ImGui . SetDragDropPayload ( 'ITEMN' , i , ImGuiCond . Always ) -- ImGui.AcceptDragDropPayload(...) -- Parameters: text (type), flags (cond) [O] -- Returns: object -- Overloads payload = ImGui . AcceptDragDropPayload ( 'ITEMN' ) payload = ImGui . AcceptDragDropPayload ( 'ITEMN' , ImGuiDragDropFlags . AcceptNoDrawDefaultRect ) -- ImGui.GetDragDropPayload() -- Returns: object payload = ImGui . GetDragDropPayload () EQ Icon rendering \u00b6 -- Get the table of icons, which live in an animation texture anim = mq . FindTextureAnimation ( 'A_SpellIcons' ) ... -- once you know the index of the icon inside the texture, set the cell anim : SetTextureCell ( spell . SpellIcon ()) -- render the texture at the cell ImGui . RenderTextureAnimation ( anim ) Events and Binds \u00b6 As alluded to earlier, lua supports events and binds similar to the macro language. The details of how to use them are documented here . Including Modules \u00b6 In general, if you have some lua code from somewhere, you can simply require('thescript') and it will be usable in your code. The fishb example does this with an external behavior tree module. There is something special to consider about loading modules like this -- they can sometimes be quite large, and in order to prevent some errors the implementation of mq2lua turns off the normal frame yielding operation to load requires. What this means is that your client can hang when you require a file, especially if it is large. The good news is that lua caches requires, so it will only hang on the first load, and won't hang again until the plugin restarts. There is another type of module that lua can include: compiled dlls. This is slightly more complex because you have to build it against the version of lua that we use in mq2lua. Luckily, this version of lua is in our vcpkg repo, so everything you need to link against is available in the mq git. LuaRocks is a great resource for these kinds of packages, and I have made detailed instructions for building these here . Config Options \u00b6 turboNum the number of instructions that will be processed before yielding the frame default: 500 luaDir the path where lua scripts live, relative to the MQ2 root directory default: 'lua' luaRequirePaths list of additional require lookup paths, written in lua require lookup format appends the global package.path in lua environments default: empty list dllRequirePaths list of additional require lookup paths for c modules, written in lua require lookup format appends the global package.cpath in lua environments default: empty list infoGC the time to garbage collect ps and info output so they don't always persist in memory accepts numbers (in milliseconds) or strings ending in 'h', 'm', 's', or 'ms' for hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds default: 1 hour squelchStatus a flag to set whether or not to print lua status messages when running, pausing, and stopping scripts default: false (do not squelch)","title":"Lua Scripting in MacroQuest"},{"location":"lua/#lua-scripting-in-macroquest","text":"Lua is in general a robust language with a multitude of tutorials and resources widely available: Main Lua Page with getting started and documentation Programming in Lua Tutorials Point Coldblooded's Lua autocompletion.

The callbacks will require a specific signature to work, so this page is here to document how to use callbacks. Lua Events \u00b6 When you set up an event, you call mq.event('name', 'matcher text', callback) . The name is just a string to identify the event with so you can remove it later with mq.unevent('name') if the event is no longer necessary. The matcher text is the same matcher text that everyone is used to from macro events, where #*# is an uncaptured wildcard and #1# is a captured wildcard that will be the first argument. More arguments are similarly captured, so you can specify the argument order in a callback. The callback is the important feature of Lua. It expects a function with a signature of (line, arg1, arg2, etc) that will process the text of the event (the full matched line and the captured arguments, ordered by number). A simple example would look like this: local function callback ( line , arg1 , arg2 ) print ( arg1 ) print ( arg2 ) end mq . event ( 'mysay' , '#1# says, #2#' , callback ) Finally, events will not automatically process (much like in the macro language) -- you will have to call mq.doevents() when it makes sense in your lua script to process the queue of captured events: while not terminate do mq . doevents () mq . delay ( 1 ) -- just yield the frame every loop end Lua Binds \u00b6 Binds are very similar to events (and even use the same backend code) with a couple of important differences.

MacroQuest also includes luarocks.exe with the compile for facilitating this install. The repository of tested LuaRocks exists at https://luarocks.macroquest.org/ and these are all verified as working. Packages can be added by submitting a pull request to the MQ LuaRocks Repo config Script Writer's Guide to using PackageMan \u00b6 PackageMan is the primary helper for installing LuaRocks modules. The simplest method for package installation is PackageMan.Require. However, there are also functions for InstallAndLoad and just Install. PackageMan.Require \u00b6 The simplest method of installing a required package is PackageMan.Require. This will check for the package, try to install it if it is not found, and try to load it after the install. If it fails, Require returns a customizable message that tells the user what happened. By default this message just states that there was a failure. An example of how to require lsqlite3 for your script is: local mq = require ( 'mq' ) local PackageMan = require ( 'mq/PackageMan' ) local sql = PackageMan . Require ( 'lsqlite3' ) This will contact the default MacroQuest rock server, install lsqlite3 and load it to be used under the sql variable. If there is a failure, the simplest message (\"Failed to load package lsqlite3\") will be displayed to the user. Require also supports overloads for packages that do not have the same name as their luarocks name would suggest. In this case, you can use two parameters for Require. An example of this is lfs. The name of the package is \"luafilesystem\" but when you load it, you load it with \"lfs\" so you can pass that information to Require as below: local mq = require ( 'mq' ) local PackageMan = require ( 'mq/PackageMan' ) local lfs = PackageMan . Require ( 'luafilesystem' , 'lfs' ) This will perform the same steps as above, but once the package is installed it uses the lfs name instead of the luafilesystem name for loading. Lastly, you can use Require to send your own custom message if you do not like the default message. This is the third overload for Require. For example, in the case that you want to return the message \"[ScriptNameHere] LFS failed to install and is required for this script\" you can do so as: local mq = require ( 'mq' ) local PackageMan = require ( 'mq/PackageMan' ) local lfs = PackageMan . Require ( 'luafilesystem' , 'lfs' , '[ScriptNameHere] LFS failed to install and is required for this sript' ) The default message should suffice for most usages. In all cases, when there is a failure to load the package using Require, your script will be exited. If you'd like more control, you can use the other functions of PackageMan. PackageMan.InstallAndLoad \u00b6 For most use cases, Require should be sufficient. However, for more granular control over what happens when a package fails to load, you can start with InstallAndLoad. This will attempt to install the package and load it. It does not check to see if the package is installed first, as that is up to the script writer. The mq/utils library has an example of an Include function which will try to load a library and gracefully fail. An example of using this library to do your own error handling on a package install is below: local mq = require ( 'mq' ) local PackageMan = require ( 'mq/PackageMan' ) local Utils = require ( 'mq/Utils' ) local sql = Utils . Library . Include ( 'lsqlite3' ) if not sql then sql = PackageMan . InstallAndLoad ( 'lsqlite3' ) end if not sql then print ( 'Could not load or install lsqlite3' ) end Because Utils.Library.Include is a graceful failure, the above code will try to load the library, install and try to load it if the initial load fails, and lastly print a message if it is still not loaded. This is useful if your script does not have a strict dependency on the library and would only use the library if it was available. InstallAndLoad also can be overloaded with an additional parameter for packages where the name is different. Referencing luafilesystem, the appropriate usage for InstallAndLoad would be: local mq = require ( 'mq' ) local PackageMan = require ( 'mq/PackageMan' ) local Utils = require ( 'mq/Utils' ) local lfs = Utils . Library . Include ( 'lfs' ) if not lfs then lfs = PackageMan . InstallAndLoad ( 'luafilesystem' , 'lfs' ) end if not lfs then print ( 'Could not load or install luafilesystem/lfs' ) end Unlike Require, InstallAndLoad does not have a third overload for a message, since you are expected to handle your own failure messages. PackageMan.Install \u00b6 If Require or InstallAndLoad does not meet your needs, then Install provides the most granular control over installing a package. Again, for most people Require should be sufficient. However, Install will allow you to determine the REASON for failures, which none of the other methods do. Install is also only responsible for installing your package, it will not try to load your package at all and it does not check if the package is already installed. The return on Install is a numerical error code, the most up to date details for which can be found in the source for PackageMan.lua. The most relevant return code that a script writer would probably be handling is error code 2 -- the user declined the installation of the package. One example of usage is below: local mq = require ( 'mq' ) local PackageMan = require ( 'mq/PackageMan' ) local Utils = require ( 'mq/Utils' ) local sql = Utils . Library . Include ( 'lsqlite3' ) if not sql then if PackageMan . Install ( 'lsqlite3' ) == 2 then print ( 'User canceled the install, cannot proceed' ) mq . exit () else sql = require ( 'lsqlite3' ) end end Advanced Configuration \u00b6 PackageMan includes parameters repoUrl and repoName for pointing users at your own repo should you want to beta test with users. However, use this at your own risk as there is no setup of maintaining multiple versions of packages from different repos.

Pardon the clunkiness. This guide will cover some of the more common building blocks of code found in macros, and ways they may be written in Lua. They may not be the only ways or the best ways, but hopefully they are useful to see. The purpose of this guide is primarily to help those who know the macro language, but not necessarily Lua or other programming languages, to be able to write new scripts in Lua. Its not to suggest that existing macros should be rewritten in Lua, although that may be a good learning exercise as well. Before getting started, its recommended to have VS Code (not the same thing as Visual Studio) installed for working with Lua files. it provides syntax highlighting out of the box and some extended capabilities when adding a Lua language server extension. Coldblooded also wrote some autocompletion utilities for MQ and ImGui which are linked below. VS Code also has an MQ macro extension, vscodemq2 which is a nice added bonus. Resources \u00b6 Getting Started Getting Started \u00b6 To get started, this guide will cover the basics of a Lua script, without getting into any of the MQ integrations. Terminology \u00b6 lua script: Like a macro, Lua scripts are run in game by issuing a command like /lua run examples/demo_tables where examples/demo_tables.lua is a Lua script which exists in the MQ Lua folder. variable: A variable is a symbolic name for some information. Variables are declared in a lua script like local script_name = 'demo_tables' . This would define the script_name variable which can then be referenced elsewhere in the script, and its value would be the string, demo_tables . Variables can be local or global , but should typically always be made local . function: A function in lua is a callable, reusable block of code. Functions can take 0 or more arguments, as well as return 0 or more results. Lua functions would be comparable to subroutines in macro script. table: In Lua, nearly everything is a table. Tables are the main data structure for the language. Think of tables as a combination of arrays, maps, sets, lists, etc. from other languages. Tables store a collection of key, value pairs, and the values can be accessed by their keys. The keys can be numbers or strings. When the keys are contiguous numbers from 1 to N, then the table can be accessed in a similar fashion to an array. They can also be iterated over by index (like an array) or by key (like a map). userdata: Lua represents arbitrary C data as the type userdata . There will be more on this later, but it is important to note that all unevaluated data returned to Lua from MQ is of type userdata . nil: The Lua equivalent of macros NULL . nil is Luas representation of no value. One common thing to do is check that a variable is not nil, i.e. the variable has a value. This might look like if mob then do_something() end . This is the same as if mob ~= nil then do_something() end . string: A string is used for data values that are made up of ordered sequences of characters, such as \"hello world\". Strings are only mentioned here because in macros, everything was a string, and in lua not everything is treated as a string. In Lua, like most programming languages, strings belong inside of quotes. This was not required in macros. For example, local name = aquietone would fail. local name = \"aquietone\" would work. literal: Defining this word here just to highlight the difference between macro script and pretty much any other programming language in the world. A literal would be something like the number 2 or the string \"hello world\" . Specifically for strings, as mentioned a few times throughout this guide, they must be in single ( ' ) or double ( \" ) quotes. This differs from macro script where strings don't need to be in quotes. true/false: Boolean values in Lua. They must be written lowercase, not to be confused with TRUE and FALSE seen in macros. One quick note on true/false in Lua is that numbers do not behave like booleans in conditions like they do in macros or several other languages. if my_int_variable then where my_int_variable is 0 would not evaluate to false . To compare numbers in if statements, the == or ~= operators should be used. Hello World \u00b6 PIL: Hello World The typical Hello World example for a Lua script is relatively short. No functions need to be written, no variables declared. Simply create a file in the MQ Lua folder called helloworld.lua with the following content: print ( 'Hello, world' ) And then execute the script in game by running the command: /lua run helloworld This script calls the built in Lua print function to print the string Hello, world . It will print to the MQ console window. The Lua print function behaves the same way as /echo in macro script. Variables \u00b6 PIL: Local Variables and Blocks Lua can have both local and global variables within the scope of a lua script, similar to a macro. In most cases, variables probably don't need to be made global. Global variables may have some use cases as script grow and begin to include multiple other scripts, but even then they are unlikely to be necessary, and most likely problems can be solved other ways. To declare a variable, its as simple as: -- DEBUG_FLAGS will be a global variable with a value of 0 DEBUG_FLAGS = 0 -- healPct will be a local variable with a value of 70 local healPct = 70 -- mobName will be a local variable which stores the string \"Fippy Darkpaw\" local mobName = \"Fippy Darkpaw\" NOTE: -- is used to write comments (text which will not be executed as part of the script) in Lua. Local variables are valid for the block of code in which they are declared in. For example: local myLevel = mq . TLO . Me . Level () if myLevel > 5 then local canUseKick = true end print ( canUseKick ) The above code snippet defines a local variable inside the if block, so it is no longer in scope after the end of the if block. The print statement will output nil because canUseKick is no longer in scope. The entirety of a lua script is also one code block. Local variables defined at the top level of the script can be referenced anywhere else in the script below where they have been defined. However, its always best to define variables as close as possible to where they will be used, and with as limited scope as possible. Variables in Lua are not strongly typed, and can be assigned all sorts of values to any variable. To keep code simple and easy to follow, avoid reusing one variable for multiple different types of data. Just note that there is nothing stopping assigning a variable a number value in one line, and then assigning it a string value in the next. The following code snippet shows some macro variable related commands and their lua equivalents: Create a local variable scriptName with the value helloworld . | /declare variable_name type scope value /declare scriptName string local helloworld local scriptName = 'helloworld' Create a global variable with the value 1 : /declare mobCount int global 1 mobCount = 1 Update the value of variable mobCount to 2 : /varset mobCount 2 mobCount = 2 Perform some math operation on a variable: /varcalc mobCount ${mobCount}+1 mobCount = mobCount + 1 Store an MQ DataType in a variable: /declare nearestNPC spawn local /vardata nearestNPC Spawn[npc targetable] local nearestNPC = nil nearestNPC = mq . TLO . Spawn ( 'npc targetable' ) Output \u00b6 In Lua, output text to the console using print . Do not use mq.cmd.echo or mq.cmd('/echo ...') . Macro: /echo some text Lua: print('Some text') Print colored text using the same color codes as /echo : Macro: /echo \\arRed text Lua: print('\\arRed text') Print the value of a variable: Macro: /echo ${scriptName} Lua: print(scriptName) Print the value of a string variable with some other text. .. is used to concatenate strings: PIL: String concatenation Macro: /echo Script Name: ${scriptName} Lua: print('Script Name: '..scriptName) NOTE: This requires that the type of data stored in the variable scriptName be a string. Another way is to use a formatted string: Lua: print(string.format('Script Name: %s', scriptName)) Another syntax for formatted strings: Lua: print(('Script Name: %s'):format(scriptName)) Refer to the C++ printf reference for details on formatted string specifiers. TIP: %s in a formatted string can cope with a variable being nil . Also check out Knightly's Write.lua resource for debug logging helpers. Functions \u00b6 PIL: Functions Lua functions are the equivalent of macro subroutines. Like variables, functions can be declared as local or global . In most cases, they don't need to be defined globally. Example 1: A function which takes no arguments Macro: Sub echoMyName /echo ${Me.Name} /return Sub Main /call echoMyName /return Lua: local function printMyName () print ( mq . TLO . Me . Name ()) end printMyName () Example 2: A function with 1 named argument Macro: Sub Main /declare scriptName global helloworld /call eyecatcher \"section about subroutines\" /return Sub eyecatcher(string message) /echo \\ar${scriptName}: \\a-x${message} /return Lua: local scriptName = 'helloworld' -- Define a local function which prints a formatted string with the script name and a message: local function eyecatcher ( message ) print ( string.format ( ' \\a r%s: \\a -x%s' , scriptName , message )) end -- Call the function which we just defined, similar to a macro /call eyecatcher \"section about subroutines\" eyecatcher ( 'section about subroutines' ) Example 3: A function with multiple named arguments Macro: Sub somefunc(bool arg1, int arg2) /echo ${arg1} /echo ${arg2} /return Sub Main /declare debug bool local true /declare id int local ${Me.ID} /call somefunc ${debug} ${id} /return Lua: local function somefunc ( arg1 , arg2 ) print ( arg1 ) print ( arg2 ) end local debug = true local id = mq . TLO . Me . ID () somefunc ( debug , id ) Example 4: A function with a variable number of arguments: PIL: Variable number of arguments local function print_values (...) local arg = {...} for _ , value in ipairs ( arg ) do print ( value ) end end local name = mq . TLO . Me . Name () local level = mq . TLO . Me . Level () local class = mq . TLO . Me . Class () print_values ( name , level , class ) Tables \u00b6 Before getting into flow control, some knowledge of Lua tables is needed. They will be used in several of the examples. In lua, tables are the goto data structure for arrays, maps, pretty much everything. Tables store key/value pairs. The keys can be numbers or strings. They aren't required to be contiguous numbers, but if using the table as an array, then they must be. NOTE: Lua array tables start from index 1. Array table examples: Define an array by passing just a set of values. It will automatically give each value an index starting from 1 . local priests = { 'clr' , 'dru' , 'shm' } Values can also be indexed explicitly: local casters = { [ 1 ] = 'enc' , [ 2 ] = 'mag' , [ 3 ] = 'nec' , [ 4 ] = 'wiz' } Lua also provides a table function for appending to arrays: local tanks = {} table.insert ( tanks , 'war' ) table.insert ( tanks , 'pal' ) table.insert ( tanks , 'shd' ) To access a value directly by its index (pretty uncommon, probably): print ( priests [ 2 ]) This would print dru . Tables can also be maps instead of arrays: local mez_classes = { brd = true , enc = true } Values from the table can be looked up by key: print ( mez_classes . brd ) print ( mez_classes [ 'brd' ]) local key = 'enc' print ( mez_classes [ key ]) While the above examples each just show grabbing a table value directly by index or key, tables will probably more often be accessed by iterating over the values. This will be covered more in the examples under the section on control flow. Deciding whether a table should be an array or a map depends on the application and how the data will be used. The examples coming up prefer using tables as maps so that values could be looked up directly by key without having to iterate over the table to find the value. One approach is to treat the table similar to a Set data structure, where the key is the unique value in the table like class short names, and the value is just true . Lua Sets provides an example helper function to create sets like this. Command Line Args/Parameters \u00b6 Lua provides access to command line arguments through the use of the same ... which was introduced earlier with functions for variable number of arguments. Below is an example which iterates over the arguments which the script is called with: local args = {...} print ( 'Script called with ' ..# args .. ' arguments:' ) for i , arg in ipairs ( args ) do print ( string.format ( 'arg[%d]: %s' , i , arg )) end Add this code to a lua script testarg1.lua and execute it with: /lua run testarg1 assist ini server_toon.ini This would output: Script called with 3 arguments : arg [ 1 ]: assist arg [ 2 ]: ini arg [ 3 ]: server_toon . ini Another example, uses named key/value arguments to add the args directly to a settings table: local settings = {} local current_key = nil for _ , arg in ipairs ( args ) do if not current_key then current_key = arg else settings [ current_key ] = arg current_key = nil end end for key , value in pairs ( settings ) do print ( string.format ( 'Settings[%s]=%s' , key , value )) end Add this code to a lua script testarg2.lua and execute it with: /lua run testarg2 role assist ini server_toon.ini This would output: Settings[role]=assist Settings[ini]=server_toon.ini Require \u00b6 The Lua require function is used to load one Lua file from another. For example, Write.lua , by Knightly, is a library which provides useful functions for logging. Write.lua is meant to be used by other scripts, and would be included with a statement like local write = require('write') . This would then allow a script to call the functions from Write.lua such as write.debug('my debug message here') . This is similar to include files in macros, though works slightly differently. Include files in macros make the macro behave as if the included files code was all inserted directly where the include was done. In Lua, the results of requiring another Lua file are typically stored into a variable. So, if a script is required, and it returns a table containing several helper functions, then that table is stored into a variable and those functions are accessed through that variable. Require is also how MQ makes its own functionality available to Lua scripts, such as TLOs, events, bindings and commands which will all be discussed later. In short, its all made available by including the following line: local mq = require 'mq' This provides access to all the MQ functionality that has been made available to lua, and assigns it into the variable mq . A short example using require: Create a file named utils.lua -- Create a table which will hold everything we want to be exported from this lua file local utils = {} -- Add a function to the utils table under the key \"perform_some_task\" utils . perform_some_task = function () print ( 'successfully performed some task' ) end -- Return the utils table containing our function return utils Then include utils.lua into the main script using a require statement: local utils = require 'utils' utils . perform_some_task () Scope and Processing Order \u00b6 Scope was touched on a little bit earlier when talking about variables. The same applies to functions as well. Its always important to be aware of where variables or functions are defined, and when they will be in the correct scope to be referenced. An important part of this is understanding that Lua scripts are processed top down. A variable or function can only be referenced by code that occurs after it has been declared. Compare these three examples: local function print_version () print ( version ) end local version = '1.0.0' print_version () This will print nil because version has not been defined ahead of the function print_version , so it will be printing an unknown variable. local version = '1.0.0' local function print_version () print ( version ) end print_version () This will print 1.0.0 because version has been defined ahead of the function print_version , so it will be able to find the correct variable. local function print_version ( version ) print ( version ) end local version = '1.0.0' print_version ( version ) While the second example works, it sort of treats version like a global variable. The scope of the version variable could be limited by passing it as an argument to the function instead. Control Flow \u00b6 PIL: Control Structures A number of options are provided to control the flow of the script, such as if then else, for loops, while loops and repeat until. If then else \u00b6 PIL: if then else If conditions from macros should look pretty similar in lua. Macro: /declare my_name string local noone /declare max_level int local 115 /if (${my_name.Equal[noone]}) { /echo the values match } /if (${Me.Level} < ${max_level}) { /echo must get more levels } | In macros, conditions usually have to check .ID on something /if (${Me.Invulnerable.ID}) { /removebuff ${Me.Invulnerable} } Lua: local my_name = 'noone' local max_level = 115 if my_name == 'noone' then print ( 'the values match' ) end if mq . TLO . Me . Level () < max_level then print ( 'must get more levels' ) end -- In Lua, conditions should be able to just check something is not nil, without -- having to check the ID. if mq . TLO . Me . Invulnerable () then mq . cmdf ( '/removebuff %s' , mq . TLO . Me . Invulnerable ()) end Macro: /if (${my_name.NotEqual[someone]}) { /echo =~ is not equals in lua } Lua: if my_name ~= 'someone' then print ( '~= is not equals in lua' ) end NOTE: Do not write a condition that combines both not and == . For example, instead of this: if not myName == 'aquietone' then use this: if myName ~= 'aquietone' then For Loops \u00b6 PIL: For Loops For loops in lua are most often going to be iterating over table values. This is done using either pairs or ipairs . Both pairs(a_table) and ipairs(a_table) will return 2 values on each pass of the loop, the key and the value for that key. pairs iterates over all keys in a table (treats the table as a map). for class , value in pairs ( mez_classes ) do print ( string.format ( 'Class %s can mez: %s' , class , value )) end ipairs iterates over contiguous numeric keys in a table starting from index 1 (treats the table as an array). for index , value in ipairs ( casters ) do print ( string.format ( 'casters[%d]=%s' , index , value )) end PIL: Numeric For Lua also allowed to iterate over a range like 1 to N: for spellIter = 1 , 5 do print ( mq . TLO . Me . Book ( spellIter ). Name ()) end Or, an example taken from pocketfarm.mac but changed so it doesn't print a lot of stuff: Macro: /for i 1 to ${SpawnCount[pc targetable]} /if (${NearestSpawn[${i},pc targetable].Name.Equal[${Me.Name}]}) { /echo ${NearestSpawn[${i},pc targetable].Name.Length} } /next i Lua: for i = 1 , mq . TLO . SpawnCount ( 'pc targetable' )() do if mq . TLO . NearestSpawn ( i .. ', pc targetable' ). Name () == mq . TLO . Me . Name () then print ( mq . TLO . NearestSpawn ( i .. ', pc targetable' ). Name . Length ()) end end While Loops \u00b6 PIL: While Loops While loops can also be used to iterate over a range: local loop = 1 while loop < 3 do print ( 'Loop #' .. loop ) loop = loop + 1 end Repeat Until \u00b6 PIL: Repeat Until There is also repeat until: repeat print ( 'Loop #' .. loop ) loop = loop - 1 until loop == 0 /goto \u00b6 This is only mentioned here because it is commonly used in macros. Avoid using this in Lua. While Lua also has goto, it should be possible to handle most situations with normal flow control like those described above. MQ \u00b6 The first line to most lua scripts written for MQ will be local mq = require 'mq' which provides access to all the MQ functionality. TLOs \u00b6 Top Level Objects, or TLOs, are how data is accessed from MQ. This should already be a pretty familiar concept from doing just about anything with MQ, including echoing data to the console, writing conditions in KissAssist INIs, writing macros, writing reacts, etc. We use TLOs every day. Some examples include ${Me} , ${Target} , ${Spawn} and ${FindItem} . To access TLOs using the mq variable: local mq = require 'mq' local assist_name = mq . TLO . Group . MainAssist . CleanName () print ( string.format ( 'Assisting: %s' , assist_name )) local mq = require 'mq' if mq . TLO . Target () then local mob_hp = mq . TLO . Target . PctHPs () if mob_hp < 98 then print ( string.format ( 'Assisting on %s' , mq . TLO . Target . CleanName ())) -- call some assist code end end local mq = require 'mq' local target = mq . TLO . Target if target () then if target . Distance3D () > 15 then print ( 'Moving closer to target' ) -- call some movement code end end In general, to convert from a TLO in macro format to a TLO in Lua format, strip the ${ } and add mq.TLO. on the front. If the goal is to evaluate the data to a Lua type, add () on the end. For example, ${Me.PctHPs} becomes mq.TLO.Me.PctHPs() . Background on Lua userdata: PIL: Userdata print ( 'type(mq.TLO.Me.Name) == ' .. type ( mq . TLO . Me . Name )) -- prints userdata print ( 'type(mq.TLO.Me.Name()) == ' .. type ( mq . TLO . Me . Name ())) -- prints string Data returned by MQ is always of type userdata. Adding () on the end will convert the MQ userdata to the appropriate lua datatype. print ( 'type(mq.TLO.Spawn(\"npc\") == ' .. type ( mq . TLO . Spawn ( \"npc\" ))) -- The following print would throw an error because userdata cannot be concatenated to a string print ( 'mq.TLO.Spawn(\"npc\") == ' .. mq . TLO . Spawn ( \"npc\" )) print ( 'type(mq.TLO.Spawn(\"npc\")() == ' .. type ( mq . TLO . Spawn ( \"npc\" )())) print ( 'mq.TLO.Spawn(\"npc\")() == ' .. mq . TLO . Spawn ( \"npc\" )()) Commands \u00b6 Execute EQ and MQ commands from Lua scripts like so: mq . cmd ( '/keypress DUCK' ) mq . delay ( 1000 ) mq . cmd ( '/keypress DUCK' ) To run a command with formatted input, use mq.cmdf : mq . cmdf ( '/echo %s' , mq . TLO . Me . Name ()) Bindings \u00b6 Lua Events and Binds Define a function for the bind to call when its executed local function bind_help () print ( 'some helpful text' ) end Assign the function to a command that can be run in game: mq . bind ( '/howto' , bind_help ) Binds can be removed using mq.unbind(bindCommand) . Events \u00b6 Lua Events and Binds First step is to define the function which will be called when the event triggers: local function event_handler () print ( 'entered event_handler' ) end Next, define the event using mq.event and pass the event name, match text, and the function. mq . event ( 'BrokenPole' , \"#*#You can't fish without a fishing pole, go buy one.#*#\" , event_handler ) Then later, typically in the main run loop of the script, call mq.doevents . mq . doevents () Similar to macros, events can also be flushed with mq.flushevents() . Events can be deregistered using mq.unevent(eventName) . Macro ${Select[...]} Statements \u00b6 Lua doesn't have ${Select[...]} quite like the macro language does, but it has other solutions: Use a loop and iterate through values: Consider a select statement like ${Select[${Me.Class.ShortName},clr,dru,shm]} local my_class = mq . TLO . Me . Class . ShortName () for _ , class in ipairs ({ 'clr' , 'dru' , 'shm' }) do if my_class == class then -- assign something or perform some action based on matching class end end Use logical operators like \"or\" (https://www.lua.org/pil/3.3.html) Consider a select statement like ${Select[${role},pullertank,tank]} local role = 'tank' if role == 'pullertank' or role == 'tank' then -- assign something or perform some action based on matching role end Use tables by checking for the presence of the value in the table Consider a select statement like ${Select[${Zone.ID},345,344,202,203,279,151,33506]} local safe_zones = { [ 345 ] = true , [ 344 ] = true , [ 202 ] = true , [ 203 ] = true , [ 279 ] = true , [ 151 ] = true , [ 33506 ] = true } local current_zone = mq . TLO . Zone . ID () if safe_zones [ current_zone ] then -- disable some functionality because we are in a safe zone end The above example checks the current zone ID against a list of zone IDs which have been classified as safe zones. local mez_classes = { brd = true , enc = true } local my_class = mq . TLO . Me . Class . ShortName () if mez_classes [ my_class ] then -- enter into mez handling routines end The above example checks the characters class against a list of mez capable classes to gate entering mez handling functions. Taking this a bit further, table values can also be functions: local function enc_mez () print ( 'handle mezzing as an enc' ) end local function brd_mez () print ( 'handle mezzing as a brd' ) end local mez_funcs = { enc = enc_mez , brd = brd_mez } local my_class = mq . TLO . Me . Class . ShortName () if mez_funcs [ my_class ] then mez_funcs [ my_class ]() -- call the function from the table end Macro /delay \u00b6 Use mq.delay to achieve the same thing as a macros /delay command. Delay a fixed amount of time: print ( 'wait 1 second then print again' ) mq . delay ( 1000 ) print ( 'finished waiting' ) Delay with a condition to end the delay early: local function should_stop_waiting () -- implement some more complex condition for when to break -- early from the delay. return not mq . TLO . Me . Casting () end print ( 'wait 5 seconds or until should_stop_waiting() returns true' ) mq . delay ( 5000 , should_stop_waiting ) print ( 'finished waiting' ) This provides a function which will be called, which should return true or false, to decide whether to cancel the delay. Macro Sub Main Function \u00b6 Lua scripts are processed from top to bottom, and don't actually require code to be inside of a function, unlike how macros always have a Sub Main where execution begins. Think of the entire lua file itself as the main function, entering at line 1 of the file when the script is run. There will often times still be blocks of code that perform a similar function to the main subroutine of a macro, like the typical /while or /goto loops people are familiar with from macros. For example, consider a macro Sub Main like below: Sub Main /while (1) { /doevents /call check_target /delay 10 } /return This could be accomplished in lua using a while loop: while true do mq . doevents () check_target () mq . delay ( 10 ) end Code like the above example will usually be near the bottom of the file, due to how lua scripts are processed. Variables and functions can only refer to things which have already been defined, i.e. were declared earlier in the file (unless defined globally, but avoid that unless necessary). Alternatively, the code could be placed inside of a function, which is then called later on near the bottom of the file. local function main () while true do mq . doevents () mq . delay ( 100 ) end end main () Macro /call and ${Macro.Return} \u00b6 Macro subroutines call other subroutines using /call my_function \"${arg1}\" . Lua functions are just called like my_function(arg1) . Macro subroutines return results using /return ${result} . Lua functions return similarly, using return result . Example: The macro Main sub calls subroutine IsPluginLoaded with argument \"mq2eqbc\". IsPluginLoaded returns the result of the Plugin.IsLoaded TLO Member, which is TRUE or FALSE. Sub IsPluginLoaded(plugin) /if (${Plugin[${plugin}].IsLoaded}) /return TRUE /return FALSE Sub Main /call IsPluginLoaded \"mq2eqbc\" /echo ${Macro.Return} /return Example: The lua script calls function IsPluginLoaded with argument 'mq2eqbc'. IsPluginLoaded returns the result of the Plugin.IsLoaded TLO Member, which is true or false. local function IsPluginLoaded ( plugin ) return mq . TLO . Plugin ( plugin ). IsLoaded () end local eqbcLoaded = IsPluginLoaded ( 'mq2eqbc' ) print ( eqbcLoaded ) mq.parse \u00b6 The mq.parse command allows to evaluate a macro expression in Lua and assign the result to a variable. This could be useful if reading macro expressions such as conditions like those in KA or reacts from an INI file. local mq = require 'mq' local IF_STMT = '${If[%s,1,0]}' local function testCondition ( condition ) -- the output from mq.parse is a string return mq . parse ( IF_STMT : format ( condition )) == '1' end -- pretend these conditions were just read in from some config file like a KA INI local conditions = { '${Me.PctHPs}<50' , '${Me.PctHPs}>50' , } for _ , condition in ipairs ( conditions ) do if testCondition ( condition ) then print (( 'Condition \"%s\" was true' ): format ( condition )) else print (( 'Condition \"%s\" was false' ): format ( condition )) end end Other commonly used TLOs \u00b6 Math : Prefer to use the native math operations supported in Lua. There's no need to use ${Math.Calc[]} or /varcalc when the language can already do 1 + 1 . For other operations like rounding, floor, ceiling, see the math library . String : Lua provides plenty of string related operations which can be found here . There should be no need to use the String TLO. .Equal and .NotEqual : No need to use macro language sorts of comparators, just use lua == and ~= instead. .Arg[|,2] : Lua provides many examples for splitting strings which remove the need to use macro .Arg . Storage \u00b6 Lua can support the same storage mechanisms that were used in macros, such as INI files, JSON, YAML, sqlite. The native Lua YAML and JSON implementations aren't particularly great, usually they have some caveats and often don't maintain formatting / pretty printing of files. They may be ok if users are never expected to hand edit the files, but that rarely seems to be the case in MQ. One new storage method which Lua makes available, is to simply persist Lua tables to a file which can then be loaded using standard Lua calls. INI \u00b6 Lua has a library LIP.lua which can be included, which some scripts have already been using. Buttonmaster, MAUI and a few others each use LIP, but with slight modifications like for supporting a wider variety of keys. This replaces the need for the INI TLO from MQ. However, it is also still possible to use the INI TLO and /ini commands. SQLite \u00b6 Some Lua scripts are including an sqlite3 DLL which can be used to connect to an SQLite database. This DLL has been compiled against the version of Lua used in MQ and works well. TradeSkill Construction Set NeXT and the Entropy macro are two example usages of use this. Lua Tables \u00b6 Several implementations are available online for persisting Lua tables to a file. Table serialization is also covered in Programming in Lua. Most of the implementations include both the writing and reading of tables to and from a file. Extras \u00b6 The /lua parse command \u00b6 MQ provides a command line utility for parsing lua, which is pretty useful for debugging. It automatically includes local mq = require('mq') , and can be used like: /lua parse mq.TLO.Me.Name() It can do much more than that, including multiple statements strung together, loops, etc. The output gets printed to the console. /lua parse i = 1 while mq.TLO.NearestSpawn(i..', pc')() do print(mq.TLO.NearestSpawn(i..', pc')) i=i+1 end The above example would print the name of PCs incrementing over a NearestSpawn search. VS Code Extensions \u00b6 In addition to ColdBlooded's emmylua definitions mentioned at the beginning, some other extensions mentioned often include: Rainbow Brackets Indent Rainbow Vscodemq2 Codemap For the codemap extension, add a reference to this javascript file (ColdBlooded's handywork again) to the codemap section in settings.json : \"codemap.mac\": \"<location of that file>\", \"use strict\" ; Object . defineProperty ( exports , \"__esModule\" , { value : true }); const fs = require ( \"fs\" ); class mapper { static read_all_lines ( file ) { let text = fs . readFileSync ( file , 'utf8' ); return text . split ( /\\r?\\n/g ); } static generate ( file ) { \"\" . match ( /.* \\(.*\\) {/g ); let members = []; try { let line_num = 0 ; mapper . read_all_lines ( file ) . forEach ( line => { line_num ++ ; line = line . trimStart (); if ( line . startsWith ( \"Sub \" )) members . push ( ` ${ line . substr ( 4 ) } | ${ line_num } |function` ); else if ( line . startsWith ( \": \" )) members . push ( ` ${ line . substr ( 1 ) } | ${ line_num } |level2` ); }); } catch ( error ) { } return members ; } } exports . mapper = mapper ; //# sourceMappingURL=mapper_md.js.map Mixing Lua and Macro \u00b6 Macro variables have always been available through the command line while a macro is running. For example, when running a macro that created a global variable MainAssistID , then it is possible to /echo ${MainAssistID} and see the value of that variable at any time. Similarly, macro variables could be updated from the console using /varset . Lua variables are not exposed in the same way, regardless of whether they are global or local. One Lua script cannot access variables from another separately running Lua script, or by the lua parse command. Lua does have access to Macro variables, through mq.TLO.Macro.Variable('macro_variable_name')() . This makes it possible to do something like use Lua to create an ImGui based UI for an existing macro. Common Problems \u00b6 Comparing values with data from mq.TLO.Something : Due to the difference between userdata and regular lua types like numbers or strings, comparisons will often fail when the values visibly look like they should be the expected type. Example: if mq . TLO . Target . CleanName == 'aquietone' then This will never succeed because mq.TLO.Target.CleanName is of type userdata , not string . It needs () on the end to trigger the evaluation from userdata to a lua string , like: if mq . TLO . Target . CleanName () == 'aquietone' Example: if mq . TLO . Target . PctHPs < 90 then This will have the same issue, printing mq.TLO.Target.PctHPs will look like a number, but it is actually userdata , and it needs to be evaluated by adding () . Command line argument types for bindings are always going to be passed into the bind function as strings. tonumber(variable) can be used to convert the type to a number in order to accept a number input to a binding command. If the input can not be parsed to a valid number, then tonumber(variable) will return nil .","title":"MacroScript to Lua"},{"location":"lua/macro-to-lua/#macroscript-to-lua","text":"Ported from RedGuides: MacroScript to Lua . Pardon the clunkiness. This guide will cover some of the more common building blocks of code found in macros, and ways they may be written in Lua. They may not be the only ways or the best ways, but hopefully they are useful to see. The purpose of this guide is primarily to help those who know the macro language, but not necessarily Lua or other programming languages, to be able to write new scripts in Lua. Its not to suggest that existing macros should be rewritten in Lua, although that may be a good learning exercise as well. Before getting started, its recommended to have VS Code (not the same thing as Visual Studio) installed for working with Lua files. it provides syntax highlighting out of the box and some extended capabilities when adding a Lua language server extension. Coldblooded also wrote some autocompletion utilities for MQ and ImGui which are linked below. VS Code also has an MQ macro extension, vscodemq2 which is a nice added bonus.","title":"MacroScript to Lua"},{"location":"lua/macro-to-lua/#resources","text":"Getting Started","title":"Resources"},{"location":"lua/macro-to-lua/#getting-started","text":"To get started, this guide will cover the basics of a Lua script, without getting into any of the MQ integrations.","title":"Getting Started"},{"location":"lua/macro-to-lua/#terminology","text":"lua script: Like a macro, Lua scripts are run in game by issuing a command like /lua run examples/demo_tables where examples/demo_tables.lua is a Lua script which exists in the MQ Lua folder. variable: A variable is a symbolic name for some information. Variables are declared in a lua script like local script_name = 'demo_tables' . This would define the script_name variable which can then be referenced elsewhere in the script, and its value would be the string, demo_tables . Variables can be local or global , but should typically always be made local . function: A function in lua is a callable, reusable block of code. Functions can take 0 or more arguments, as well as return 0 or more results. Lua functions would be comparable to subroutines in macro script. table: In Lua, nearly everything is a table. Tables are the main data structure for the language. Think of tables as a combination of arrays, maps, sets, lists, etc. from other languages. Tables store a collection of key, value pairs, and the values can be accessed by their keys. The keys can be numbers or strings. When the keys are contiguous numbers from 1 to N, then the table can be accessed in a similar fashion to an array. They can also be iterated over by index (like an array) or by key (like a map). userdata: Lua represents arbitrary C data as the type userdata . There will be more on this later, but it is important to note that all unevaluated data returned to Lua from MQ is of type userdata . nil: The Lua equivalent of macros NULL . nil is Luas representation of no value. One common thing to do is check that a variable is not nil, i.e. the variable has a value. This might look like if mob then do_something() end . This is the same as if mob ~= nil then do_something() end . string: A string is used for data values that are made up of ordered sequences of characters, such as \"hello world\". Strings are only mentioned here because in macros, everything was a string, and in lua not everything is treated as a string. In Lua, like most programming languages, strings belong inside of quotes. This was not required in macros. For example, local name = aquietone would fail. local name = \"aquietone\" would work. literal: Defining this word here just to highlight the difference between macro script and pretty much any other programming language in the world. A literal would be something like the number 2 or the string \"hello world\" . Specifically for strings, as mentioned a few times throughout this guide, they must be in single ( ' ) or double ( \" ) quotes. This differs from macro script where strings don't need to be in quotes. true/false: Boolean values in Lua. They must be written lowercase, not to be confused with TRUE and FALSE seen in macros. One quick note on true/false in Lua is that numbers do not behave like booleans in conditions like they do in macros or several other languages. if my_int_variable then where my_int_variable is 0 would not evaluate to false . To compare numbers in if statements, the == or ~= operators should be used.","title":"Terminology"},{"location":"lua/macro-to-lua/#hello-world","text":"PIL: Hello World The typical Hello World example for a Lua script is relatively short. No functions need to be written, no variables declared. Simply create a file in the MQ Lua folder called helloworld.lua with the following content: print ( 'Hello, world' ) And then execute the script in game by running the command: /lua run helloworld This script calls the built in Lua print function to print the string Hello, world . It will print to the MQ console window. The Lua print function behaves the same way as /echo in macro script.","title":"Hello World"},{"location":"lua/macro-to-lua/#variables","text":"PIL: Local Variables and Blocks Lua can have both local and global variables within the scope of a lua script, similar to a macro. In most cases, variables probably don't need to be made global. Global variables may have some use cases as script grow and begin to include multiple other scripts, but even then they are unlikely to be necessary, and most likely problems can be solved other ways. To declare a variable, its as simple as: -- DEBUG_FLAGS will be a global variable with a value of 0 DEBUG_FLAGS = 0 -- healPct will be a local variable with a value of 70 local healPct = 70 -- mobName will be a local variable which stores the string \"Fippy Darkpaw\" local mobName = \"Fippy Darkpaw\" NOTE: -- is used to write comments (text which will not be executed as part of the script) in Lua. Local variables are valid for the block of code in which they are declared in. For example: local myLevel = mq . TLO . Me . Level () if myLevel > 5 then local canUseKick = true end print ( canUseKick ) The above code snippet defines a local variable inside the if block, so it is no longer in scope after the end of the if block. The print statement will output nil because canUseKick is no longer in scope. The entirety of a lua script is also one code block. Local variables defined at the top level of the script can be referenced anywhere else in the script below where they have been defined. However, its always best to define variables as close as possible to where they will be used, and with as limited scope as possible. Variables in Lua are not strongly typed, and can be assigned all sorts of values to any variable. To keep code simple and easy to follow, avoid reusing one variable for multiple different types of data. Just note that there is nothing stopping assigning a variable a number value in one line, and then assigning it a string value in the next. The following code snippet shows some macro variable related commands and their lua equivalents: Create a local variable scriptName with the value helloworld . | /declare variable_name type scope value /declare scriptName string local helloworld local scriptName = 'helloworld' Create a global variable with the value 1 : /declare mobCount int global 1 mobCount = 1 Update the value of variable mobCount to 2 : /varset mobCount 2 mobCount = 2 Perform some math operation on a variable: /varcalc mobCount ${mobCount}+1 mobCount = mobCount + 1 Store an MQ DataType in a variable: /declare nearestNPC spawn local /vardata nearestNPC Spawn[npc targetable] local nearestNPC = nil nearestNPC = mq .

They will be used in several of the examples. In lua, tables are the goto data structure for arrays, maps, pretty much everything. Tables store key/value pairs. The keys can be numbers or strings. They aren't required to be contiguous numbers, but if using the table as an array, then they must be. NOTE: Lua array tables start from index 1. Array table examples: Define an array by passing just a set of values. It will automatically give each value an index starting from 1 . local priests = { 'clr' , 'dru' , 'shm' } Values can also be indexed explicitly: local casters = { [ 1 ] = 'enc' , [ 2 ] = 'mag' , [ 3 ] = 'nec' , [ 4 ] = 'wiz' } Lua also provides a table function for appending to arrays: local tanks = {} table.insert ( tanks , 'war' ) table.insert ( tanks , 'pal' ) table.insert ( tanks , 'shd' ) To access a value directly by its index (pretty uncommon, probably): print ( priests [ 2 ]) This would print dru . Tables can also be maps instead of arrays: local mez_classes = { brd = true , enc = true } Values from the table can be looked up by key: print ( mez_classes . brd ) print ( mez_classes [ 'brd' ]) local key = 'enc' print ( mez_classes [ key ]) While the above examples each just show grabbing a table value directly by index or key, tables will probably more often be accessed by iterating over the values. This will be covered more in the examples under the section on control flow. Deciding whether a table should be an array or a map depends on the application and how the data will be used. The examples coming up prefer using tables as maps so that values could be looked up directly by key without having to iterate over the table to find the value. One approach is to treat the table similar to a Set data structure, where the key is the unique value in the table like class short names, and the value is just true .

For example, Write.lua , by Knightly, is a library which provides useful functions for logging. Write.lua is meant to be used by other scripts, and would be included with a statement like local write = require('write') . This would then allow a script to call the functions from Write.lua such as write.debug('my debug message here') . This is similar to include files in macros, though works slightly differently. Include files in macros make the macro behave as if the included files code was all inserted directly where the include was done. In Lua, the results of requiring another Lua file are typically stored into a variable. So, if a script is required, and it returns a table containing several helper functions, then that table is stored into a variable and those functions are accessed through that variable. Require is also how MQ makes its own functionality available to Lua scripts, such as TLOs, events, bindings and commands which will all be discussed later. In short, its all made available by including the following line: local mq = require 'mq' This provides access to all the MQ functionality that has been made available to lua, and assigns it into the variable mq . A short example using require: Create a file named utils.lua -- Create a table which will hold everything we want to be exported from this lua file local utils = {} -- Add a function to the utils table under the key \"perform_some_task\" utils . perform_some_task = function () print ( 'successfully performed some task' ) end -- Return the utils table containing our function return utils Then include utils.lua into the main script using a require statement: local utils = require 'utils' utils . perform_some_task ()","title":"Require"},{"location":"lua/macro-to-lua/#scope-and-processing-order","text":"Scope was touched on a little bit earlier when talking about variables.

Usage \u00b6 In order to use these built-in variables, you need to pick a Top-Level Object to start with, and then \"build\" the variable by adding one or more DataType members of that TLO. It's best understood with some examples. Note: TLOs and members are all case sensitive, so enter them exactly as seen. Example 1: Mana Percentage \u00b6 Say you want to display your current Mana Percentage in a HUD or use it in a macro. First off, you look through the list of TLOs and pick one that best suits the information you're looking for. The Me TLO looks like a good bet. Opening that page, you see that the Me TLO has access to the character datatype and the spawn datatype. The character datatype contains information about your own character, mostly things that only you will know (eg. how much mana you have, what spells you have loaded, etc). Since your character is also a spawn in the EQ world (ie. other people can see you and interact with you), you are also able to access the spawn datatype, which gives information that other characters in the same zone may know (eg. your location, your race, your class, etc). Since we're looking for your Mana Percentage, this is something that only you can know, so choose the character datatype page. This will display a list of all the members that are available to character . In the front of each datatype is an italic word, which is the datatype that the member belongs to. It may seem a bit confusing right now but should get easier as we progress to more complex examples. Scroll down the list until you find a member that looks like it will give us what we need. The PctMana member looks good. The int in front of PctMana shows that it is an integer. Since we're expecting a number, this seems correct. Click on the int link and you'll notice another table similar to the character datatype. This table has all the members of the int datatype. Note that the bottom line of the list is **To String_ , which is the default for the datatype. The default for the_ int datatype is the number. Since we're just looking for the number, we can stop here. So now we can \"build\" our variable. Remember, all variables start with a $-sign and are surrounded by braces { }. We start with our TLO: ${Me Then we add a period to indicate that we want to include a member of Me : ${Me. Now we add the first datatype, PctMana : ${Me.PctMana Now PctMana is an int and the default for int is just the number, so we don't need to add any members of int . So we can close off the variable now: ${Me.PctMana} To test this variable, you can echo it in the EQ client. So typing the following will echo your mana percentage to the MQ2 chat window: /echo ${Me.PctMana} Example 2: Class ShortName \u00b6 The next example deals with getting your class short name (the 3-letter abbreviation of your class). Find the most likely TLO again. Again, the Me TLO looks best. Find the member you would like to select. To find the members of Me , go to Character Scrolling through the members of Me , Class looks like the best candidate. The class datatype has a default of \"Same as Name\". Looking at the Name member, we can see that it is the \"long name\" of the class (eg. Enchanter). We're actually looking for the short name, so we need to find a member of class found here Class . Funny enough, ShortName looks like it will do the job. ShortName is a string datatype and the default for this datatype (surprisingly) is the string, and since we're looking for a 3-letter string, this is perfect. So now we've found our endpoint, we can build the variable as before. Start with the TLO: ${Me Add the first member ${Me.Class Since we need a member of Class , we add another period and the next member ${Me.Class.ShortName We've now arrived at the end of our variable, so we \"close\" it here ${Me.Class.ShortName} Again, to test, we echo the variable and see that the result is what we expect. /echo ${Me.Class.ShortName} Example 3: Comparison using a string \u00b6 For the next example, we will use the variable and compare it to a string in an if statement. Let's say we want to echo something if we're a bard, and something else if we're not. We'll be using the same ShortName example as above, but since we don't just want to echo the current short name, we have to go a step further. Go back to the ShortName member and you'll see that it is a string datatype. Under the string datatype, you'll see the Equals member. This is the one we'll be using. Equals is a bool datatype, which means that it doesn't have any members. It will return 1 if true and 0 if false, which is good enough for our test. In the following example, I'll be using an /if statement. For the purposes of this example, you don't need to understand how they work, but they're the staple of MQ2, so it's a good idea to have a look at the Flow Control page and familiarize yourself with /if and its friends. Returning to the example though, let's build the variable. We'll start with where we left off in the previous example. Since we want to access a member of ShortName , we won't close it off: /if (${Me.Class.ShortName You'll notice that the Equals datatype has square brackets after it, which means that you need to enter something between the brackets. This can be another variable or just a string. For this example, we're checking if we're a bard: /if (${Me.Class.ShortName.Equals[BRD] Remember that we're using ShortName , so we need to include the 3-letter abbreviation. Since this is the end of the variable ( Equals is a bool ), we can close it off: /if (${Me.Class.ShortName.Equals[BRD]} But this is actually an /if statement, and we need to close that off to, so lets make it echo something if we're a bard. /if (${Me.Class.ShortName.Equal[BRD]}) { /echo Catch me if you can! } We'll flesh this out a bit more by echoing one thing if we're a bard and another if we're not: /if (${Me.Class.ShortName.Equal[BRD]}) { /echo Catch me if you can! } else { /echo Nerf bards! }","title":"Beginners Guide to TLOs and DataVars"},{"location":"macros/beginners-guide-datatypes/#beginners-guide-to-tlos-and-datavars","text":"","title":"Beginners Guide to TLOs and DataVars"},{"location":"macros/beginners-guide-datatypes/#introduction","text":"Top-Level Objects (TLOs) are basically \"built-in\" global variables that contain information from the EQ client.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"macros/beginners-guide-datatypes/#usage","text":"In order to use these built-in variables, you need to pick a Top-Level Object to start with, and then \"build\" the variable by adding one or more DataType members of that TLO.

Since this is the end of the variable ( Equals is a bool ), we can close it off: /if (${Me.Class.ShortName.Equals[BRD]} But this is actually an /if statement, and we need to close that off to, so lets make it echo something if we're a bard. /if (${Me.Class.ShortName.Equal[BRD]}) { /echo Catch me if you can! } We'll flesh this out a bit more by echoing one thing if we're a bard and another if we're not: /if (${Me.Class.ShortName.Equal[BRD]}) { /echo Catch me if you can! } else { /echo Nerf bards! }","title":"Example 3: Comparison using a string"},{"location":"macros/comments/","text":"Comments \u00b6 Comments Comments are descriptive lines in a macro to make reading easier.

Basically any text that is displayed in an EQ chat window, or in the MQ2 chat window can be used. You are able to use parts of the text as parameters for your event subroutine. An example of an #event is below: #event Invite \"BillyBob invites you to join a group.\" This means that when the text \"BillyBob invites you to join a group.\" appears on screen, the event will queue up. It's important to remember that the event will not trigger it's subroutine until you allow it to in your macro. You do so by adding \"/doevents\" or \"/doevents Invite\" at an appropriate point in your macro. When your macro hits the /doevents line, it will trigger any events that are queued up. At this point, the macro will look for the appropriately named subroutine, which in the above case is \"Sub Event_Invite\". So to flesh out the example above, we should have the following macro: #event Invite \"BillyBob invites you to join a group.\" Sub Main :mainloop /doevents /delay 0 /goto :mainloop /return Sub Event_Invite /echo BillyBob invited me! /return This will keep running /doevents and when it senses the #event trigger text, it will /echo the text in the Event Sub. Using part of the #event text as a variable \u00b6 Now while the above example is pretty useful (eg. you can accept the invite in the Sub Event_Invite), what if we want to accept invites from more than one person? We could create two separate events and have them each echo a different piece of text. Or we could use part of the event text as a variable and manipulate it in the subroutine . You can do this by marking out the part of text you want to use as a variable. In the above example, we'll use the inviter's name: #event Invite \"#1# invites you to join a group.\" Sub Main :mainloop /doevents /goto :mainloop /return Sub Event_Invite(Line,Inviter) /echo ${Inviter} invited me! /return A few things to note about the above example: Firstly, we use #1# to mark the first variable that we'd like passed to our Sub. If you want more than one variable to be passed, you can use #2# and greater to indicate other variables. Secondly, the above Sub has two variables passed to it - ${Line} and ${Inviter}. 1. The #event system will always pass the entire line of matched text to the subroutine as the first variable. Even if you don't wish to use the entire line of text, you need to define the variable. Using \"Line\" as the first variable is very common. However the first variable can be called whatever you'd like, especially if you'd like to use the line in your Sub! The next variable, Inviter, is the one we're interested in, and will match whatever's between the first set of # symbols in the #event line. So when the text \"PeggySue invites you to a group.\" appears in a chat window, the same event will trigger, and it will echo \"PeggySue invited me!\" in the MQ2 chat window. Ignoring parts of the #event text \u00b6 You can also ignore certain parts of the trigger text by using #*#. So the example: #event Invite \"#1# invites you to join #*#\" Would trigger when someone invited you to a group or a raid. Using variables in the #event text \u00b6 You can also have the #event system parse variables at the time of the match too. In the following example: #event Follow \"#*#follow |${Me.CleanName}|'\" When the text, apart from what is between the | symbols, is matched, it then evaluates what's between the | symbols and the event is triggered if the variable matches the text. So if ${Me.CleanName} was \"PeggySue\", the following text would not be matched: BillyBob tells the raid, 'follow me' While the following text would be: BillyBob tells the raid, 'follow PeggySue' #chat Special event \u00b6 The #chat command is a special custom event. It will always pass the channel, sender and text to the Sub Event_Chat subroutine. So your Sub Event_Chat should look something like this: Sub Event_Chat(ChatChannel,ChatSender,ChatText) /echo ${ChatSender} told me ${ChatText} in ${ChatChannel} /return Variable names can be anything you choose. Timer Events \u00b6 This is another special custom event. The name of the Timer and the Original Value it was set to, are passed to the subroutine as soon as the timer reaches 0. For example: Sub Event_Timer(Timer,OriginalValue) /echo ${Timer} reached 0, original value was ${OriginalValue} /return Notes and Tips \u00b6 Because the system lets you pick the parameter number of any portion of the message, some parameters may not get defined. It's up to you to make sure you define all the needed parameters, and to make sure they're defined as the correct type (string, int, bool, etc). Pay particular attention to the syntax of your #event line. It will only trigger if the text is identical , so best to check it against text in game or in your log file. If your death event no longer works \u00b6 Note: This should be fixed as of the 20060628 MQ2 release. A common use for #event in a lot of macros was for use when you died, something like this: #event Died \"#*#You have entered#*#\" Due to a few small bugs, this event did not always work. To work around this, you can do the following: Declare an outer variable with the ID of your zone in the Main sub. Somewhere in your main loop, add a check that calls the #event if the zone is not the same. Reset the outer variable within your event. For example #event Died \"#*#You have entered#*#\" sub Main /declare zonecheck int outer ${Zone.ID} :main_loop /if (${zonecheck} != ${Zone.ID}) /call Event_Died /delay 0 /goto :main_loop /return sub Event_Died /varset zonecheck ${Zone.ID} /sit /delay 10s /afk /endmacro /return","title":"Custom Events"},{"location":"macros/custom-events/#custom-events","text":"","title":"Custom Events"},{"location":"macros/custom-events/#basic-event-usage","text":"The Custom Event system allows you to trigger Subroutines off of any text that reaches the EQ client.

Since we will be looting NPC corpses we have no need to consent. By a quick glance, there's only a few lines that deal with consenting: | -------------- | -- Consents -- | -------------- /consent guild /delay 30 /consent raid /delay 30 /consent group /echo Awaiting rez: will auto-accept, then loot leaving ${lootleft} item/s on corpse Now, let's look at the waiting for rez section. Again, when we kill a NPC we won't be getting a rez box, so that section can be removed as well. | --------------------- | -- Auto-accept Rez -- | --------------------- :waitforrez /if (!${Window[ConfirmationDialogBox].Open}) { /delay 1s ${Window[ConfirmationDialogBox].Open} /goto :waitforrez } /if (${Window[ConfirmationDialogBox].Open}) /notify ConfirmationDialogBox Yes_Button leftmouseup Looking at the code, the next thing it does is it waits until it's fully zoned before looting. I'd surely hope you were fully zoned before looting a NPC corpse you just killed, so there's another section we can axe. | ---------------------------------------------- | -- Wait until fully zoned in before looting -- | ---------------------------------------------- :zonein /delay 5 /target mycorpse /delay 5 ${Target.CleanName.Equal[${Me}'s corpse]} /if (${Target.CleanName.NotEqual[${Me}'s corpse]}) /goto :zonein /if (${Target.CleanName.Equal[${Me}'s corpse]}) { /delay 3s /call Loot } else { /goto :zonein } /end Here we go again - next section deals with using the built in command /corpse to summon the corpse. (In case it was moved since you had been rezzed.) | ----------------------- | -- Pull corpse close -- | ----------------------- Sub Loot :corpsepull /target mycorpse /delay 5 ${Target.CleanName.Equal[${Me}'s corpse]} /if (${Target.CleanName.NotEqual[${Me}'s corpse]}) { /echo No corpse in this zone /return } /delay 3s /corpse /delay 1s ${Target.Distance}<20 /if (${Target.Distance}>20) { /echo Corpse is too far away /return } Now the next section we run across our first spot where we will use something, and remove something from the same section. Before we do that though, we need to take a brief look into one of the most basic programming ideas, the IF-THEN statement. In plain english, an IF-THEN statement reads just like this: if A is true, then do B. Now, we can add a little to it, and add ELSE. IF-THEN-ELSE would read in plain english like this: if A is true, then B, otherwise(else) do C. Now, each programming language is different, but the basic way MacroQuest evaluates this is something similar to this: /if (A) { B } else { C } If this does not make sense to you, re-read it a few times. This is a very basic concept, don't make it harder than it is. Back on track, let's look at the next section of the Wait4Rez macro: | --------------------- | -- Open the corpse -- | --------------------- /if (${Target.CleanName.Equal[${Me}'s corpse]}) { /loot } else { /echo where did my corpse go? /return } /delay 5s ${Me.State.Equal[BIND]} /if (${Me.State.NotEqual[BIND]}) /goto :corpsepull /varset loottotal 0 Now I am NOT a coder. I learned one type of code and as soon as I got proficient, everything changed. Ever since then I haven't really done much of anything with code. Using common sense, however, we can read most of this section. Here's the section again, the bolded is plain english of what I think it means. | --------------------- | -- Open the corpse -- | --------------------- /if (${Target.CleanName.Equal[${Me}'s corpse]}) { /if`` ``(My`` ``Target's`` ``Name`` ``is`` ``Equal`` ``to`` ``Myname's`` ``corpse)`` ``{ /loot Use`` ``the`` ``EQ`` ``command`` ``/loot } else { Otherwise /echo where did my corpse go? Put`` ``this`` ``text`` ``in`` ``the`` ``MQ2`` ``Window /return End`` ``macro } /delay 5s ${Me.State.Equal[BIND]} /if (${Me.State.NotEqual[BIND]}) /goto :corpsepull /varset loottotal 0 Some of that IF-THEN-ELSE statement will not be needed for our macro. We will need the /loot part, but the rest of it can be canned. Also in that section is a delay of some sort - 5s (assuming 5 seconds) and then a statement that sorta looks like it's asking if we are binding wound. Then it has another IF-THEN statement that looks like IF you aren't in the bind wound position THEN goto :corpsepull. We removed corpsepull already, so it looks like we can get rid of the statement in whole. The /varset was put in there for a reason, and I'm not entirely sure why yet - so I'm going to leave it in. So now, we have this: |** Wait4rez.mac by FaNTuM This will automatically accept rez, then loot your corpse for you, leaving the specified number of items on it.

Now, let's change one thing that's been bothering me. FaNTuM's macro by default leaves 1 item on the corpse. If we're looting NPC's then we don't need to leave 1 item on the corpse at all. (Unless you are a Necro or you group with one often that is) Scanning the code I see: /declare lootleft int outer 1 Which I'm pretty sure is the variable that is the default of how many items to leave on the corpse. Let's try changing it to 0. I also noticed, just by looking at the code logically, that we currently have no way of targeting our corpse. Keeping it simple, let's add in a /target corpse somewhere before it attempts to open a loot window. Now, we can edit or remove the /echo statements - all /echo statements do it put text in your MQ2 Chat Window. I'm going to just delete them all - we can always add them in later if we decide we need to be told that we just looted something. Looks good - Now I'll just edit the comments at the top to better reflect what this macro does and we're finished. |** Loot.mac by TheNewGuy 20 July 2005 Make a hotkey: /mac loot.mac When something dies, push that hotkey as you are standing over the corpse.

By a quick glance, there's only a few lines that deal with consenting: | -------------- | -- Consents -- | -------------- /consent guild /delay 30 /consent raid /delay 30 /consent group /echo Awaiting rez: will auto-accept, then loot leaving ${lootleft} item/s on corpse Now, let's look at the waiting for rez section. Again, when we kill a NPC we won't be getting a rez box, so that section can be removed as well. | --------------------- | -- Auto-accept Rez -- | --------------------- :waitforrez /if (!${Window[ConfirmationDialogBox].Open}) { /delay 1s ${Window[ConfirmationDialogBox].Open} /goto :waitforrez } /if (${Window[ConfirmationDialogBox].Open}) /notify ConfirmationDialogBox Yes_Button leftmouseup Looking at the code, the next thing it does is it waits until it's fully zoned before looting. I'd surely hope you were fully zoned before looting a NPC corpse you just killed, so there's another section we can axe. | ---------------------------------------------- | -- Wait until fully zoned in before looting -- | ---------------------------------------------- :zonein /delay 5 /target mycorpse /delay 5 ${Target.CleanName.Equal[${Me}'s corpse]} /if (${Target.CleanName.NotEqual[${Me}'s corpse]}) /goto :zonein /if (${Target.CleanName.Equal[${Me}'s corpse]}) { /delay 3s /call Loot } else { /goto :zonein } /end Here we go again - next section deals with using the built in command /corpse to summon the corpse. (In case it was moved since you had been rezzed.) | ----------------------- | -- Pull corpse close -- | ----------------------- Sub Loot :corpsepull /target mycorpse /delay 5 ${Target.CleanName.Equal[${Me}'s corpse]} /if (${Target.CleanName.NotEqual[${Me}'s corpse]}) { /echo No corpse in this zone /return } /delay 3s /corpse /delay 1s ${Target.Distance}<20 /if (${Target.Distance}>20) { /echo Corpse is too far away /return } Now the next section we run across our first spot where we will use something, and remove something from the same section. Before we do that though, we need to take a brief look into one of the most basic programming ideas, the IF-THEN statement. In plain english, an IF-THEN statement reads just like this: if A is true, then do B. Now, we can add a little to it, and add ELSE. IF-THEN-ELSE would read in plain english like this: if A is true, then B, otherwise(else) do C. Now, each programming language is different, but the basic way MacroQuest evaluates this is something similar to this: /if (A) { B } else { C } If this does not make sense to you, re-read it a few times. This is a very basic concept, don't make it harder than it is. Back on track, let's look at the next section of the Wait4Rez macro: | --------------------- | -- Open the corpse -- | --------------------- /if (${Target.CleanName.Equal[${Me}'s corpse]}) { /loot } else { /echo where did my corpse go? /return } /delay 5s ${Me.State.Equal[BIND]} /if (${Me.State.NotEqual[BIND]}) /goto :corpsepull /varset loottotal 0 Now I am NOT a coder. I learned one type of code and as soon as I got proficient, everything changed. Ever since then I haven't really done much of anything with code. Using common sense, however, we can read most of this section. Here's the section again, the bolded is plain english of what I think it means. | --------------------- | -- Open the corpse -- | --------------------- /if (${Target.CleanName.Equal[${Me}'s corpse]}) { /if`` ``(My`` ``Target's`` ``Name`` ``is`` ``Equal`` ``to`` ``Myname's`` ``corpse)`` ``{ /loot Use`` ``the`` ``EQ`` ``command`` ``/loot } else { Otherwise /echo where did my corpse go? Put`` ``this`` ``text`` ``in`` ``the`` ``MQ2`` ``Window /return End`` ``macro } /delay 5s ${Me.State.Equal[BIND]} /if (${Me.State.NotEqual[BIND]}) /goto :corpsepull /varset loottotal 0 Some of that IF-THEN-ELSE statement will not be needed for our macro. We will need the /loot part, but the rest of it can be canned. Also in that section is a delay of some sort - 5s (assuming 5 seconds) and then a statement that sorta looks like it's asking if we are binding wound. Then it has another IF-THEN statement that looks like IF you aren't in the bind wound position THEN goto :corpsepull. We removed corpsepull already, so it looks like we can get rid of the statement in whole. The /varset was put in there for a reason, and I'm not entirely sure why yet - so I'm going to leave it in. So now, we have this: |** Wait4rez.mac by FaNTuM This will automatically accept rez, then loot your corpse for you, leaving the specified number of items on it.

Now, let's change one thing that's been bothering me. FaNTuM's macro by default leaves 1 item on the corpse. If we're looting NPC's then we don't need to leave 1 item on the corpse at all. (Unless you are a Necro or you group with one often that is) Scanning the code I see: /declare lootleft int outer 1 Which I'm pretty sure is the variable that is the default of how many items to leave on the corpse. Let's try changing it to 0. I also noticed, just by looking at the code logically, that we currently have no way of targeting our corpse. Keeping it simple, let's add in a /target corpse somewhere before it attempts to open a loot window. Now, we can edit or remove the /echo statements - all /echo statements do it put text in your MQ2 Chat Window. I'm going to just delete them all - we can always add them in later if we decide we need to be told that we just looted something. Looks good - Now I'll just edit the comments at the top to better reflect what this macro does and we're finished. |** Loot.mac by TheNewGuy 20 July 2005 Make a hotkey: /mac loot.mac When something dies, push that hotkey as you are standing over the corpse.

If/else decisions While loops For loops Goto jumps If/else decisions \u00b6 If statement blocks are the most common form of flow control in MQ2. The syntax for an /if statement can be found here . The simplest statements are one-liners like the following: /if (${Me.Sitting}) /stand This will stand you up if you're sitting. *One-line /if statements do not require curly braces ( {} ) If you wish to execute more than one command, you must wrap your set of commands in braces: /if (${Me.Sitting}) { /stand /echo I'm standing now! } *If statements can also match multiple conditions for fine-grained control: /if (${Me.Standing} && !${Me.Combat} && !${Me.Casting.ID}) { /sit /echo Medding now } The above example will only be matched if you're currently standing and you're not in combat and you're not casting. Any of the Operators can be used to \"fine-tune\" the matching of any conditions. Also, brackets can be used to group certain sets of statements together. /if ( (${Me.Sitting} && !${Window[SpellBookWnd].Open}) || ${Me.Standing} ) /call Cast \"Complete Healing\" 10s This will only cast the spell if: I'm sitting and the spellbook window is not open OR I'm standing. You will also need the curly braces any time you're using else or else if statements. An example: /if (${Me.Sitting}) { /stand /echo I'm standing now! } else { /echo I'm already standing } Else blocks are extremely useful for catching \"everything else\" that is not matched by the /if statement. You can go one further and add some further matching with additional /if statments, like the following: /declare random int local ${Math.Rand[10]} /if (${random}<=3) { /echo The number is less than or equal to 3 } else /if (${random}<=5) { /echo The number is less than or equal to 5 } else /if (${random}<=8) { /echo The number is less than or equal to 8 } else { /echo The number is 9 or higher } You can also nest /if statements within other /if statements, to make your matching and macro flow very powerful. While loops \u00b6 Similar to for loops, while loops can be used to execute a series of commands as long as a certain set of conditions are or are not true. /while (${Me.PctHPs}<100 || ${Me.PctMana}<100) { /if (${Me.Standing}) { /echo Sitting because I am standing. /sit } /echo Resting until my hitpoints (${Me.PctHPs}%) and mana (${Me.PctMana}%) are at 100%. /delay 6s } You can end a /while loop immediately with /break or try the next iteration with /continue For loops \u00b6 For loops are used when you want to perform the same set of commands on a list of items. With a /for loop, you define a starting number, an end number and (if necessary) a number to increment by. The loop will perform the set of commands with the starting number, then will increment it (by 1 as a default, unless you specify the number) and will then re-run all the commands with the next number. It will continue to do that until it reaches the end number, at which time it will exit. Take this example, which will give a list of all your buff slots: /declare x int local /for x 1 to 15 /echo Buff ${x} is ${Me.Buff[${x}]} /next x The problem with this example is that you'll get a couple of NULLs if you have no buffs in those slots, so we can further refine the loop to make use of an /if statement as well, like this: /declare x int local /for x 1 to 15 /if (${Me.Buff[${x}].ID}) /echo Buff ${x} is ${Me.Buff[${x}]} /next x This will have a look and see if the buff in slot ${x} has an ID (remember that /if statements only deal with numbers) and if the number is positive (ie. not 0), then it will echo the buff name. You could easily list the buffs in reverse order by using \"downto\" instead of \"to\" in the /for loop. /declare x int local /for x 15 downto 1 /if (${Me.Buff[${x}].ID}) /echo Buff ${x} is ${Me.Buff[${x}]} /next x You can end a /for loop immediately with /break or try the next iteration with /continue. Goto jumps \u00b6 As with most programming and scripting languages, the use of the \"goto\" function is frowned upon (generally because it's slow and there are better ways of achieving the same result). In MQ2 it's not much different, and since MQ2 originally didn't include any type of \"while\" function, many older macros still include goto statements. First off, you need a marker to denote where the /goto function should move to. A marker is created in the following format: :marker To utilize that marker with a /goto statment, do something like the following: Sub Main /echo start here :marker /echo just passed the marker /goto :marker /return In the above example, your MQ2 chat window would be filled with \"just passed the marker\" echoed constantly until you ended the macro. We've created an infinite loop above, which is the most common use of /goto. A conditional /goto (ie. a /goto after an /if statment) is the closest you can get to a \"while\" function. Take the following example: Sub Main /declare num int local 1 :marker /echo Number is ${num} /varcalc ${num} ${num}+1 /if (${num}<=5) /goto :marker /return This would output: [MQ2] Number is 1 [MQ2] Number is 2 [MQ2] Number is 3 [MQ2] Number is 4 [MQ2] Number is 5 The macro echoes \"${num}\" and then increments it by one. If the total is less than or equal to 5, it loops back to the start. If the total is above 5, it won't loop back and will end naturally. :OnExit \u00b6 Anything included after that label will be called whenever an /endmacro command is issued. To use this feature, the label must be at the end of your 'Sub Main' function and end with a /return. Please note that this is NOT required of macros, so no macros will have to be altered unless you wish to take advantage of this feature. OnExit will not function upon a macro ending while paused. example: Sub Main /while (1) { /delay 5 } /return :OnExit /echo Should run on exit. /return","title":"Flow Control"},{"location":"macros/flow-control/#flow-control","text":"MQ2 provides a few ways to control the execution of your macro.

In Explorer, go to Tools - Folder Options - View tab and untick the option \"Hide extensions for known file types\" . Then rename the file and change the extension to .mac. Due to complete misuse of the String Top-Level Object, it has been removed. \u00b6 A while back, macro writers were incorrectly using the ${String} TLO in their macros. In order to prevent people from using this TLO incorrectly, thus slowing down their macros, and in an attempt to teach people to create their macros properly and efficiently from the get-go, the ${String} TLO was removed. Finding this error when running a macro generally means you have an old copy of a macro. Most macros have been updated to not use the ${String} TLO and therefore the first place you should be looking is **in the forum thread where you obtained your macro**. Fixing the error is easy when you know what to look for, but a bit more tricky in a complicated macro or if you're not a macro maker yourself. Here's a simple example that should help explain it. The code: /if (${String[${Me.Gem[1]}].NotEqual[Complete Healing]}) /memspell 1 \"Complete Healing\" What this does is check if the spell name of the spell in the first slot is \"Complete Healing\" *(the /if statement inside the brackets) . If it is not, then mem \"Complete Healing\" in slot 1 (the /memspell bit after the brackets)*. If we look in the manual, we see the following entry for the Gem reference type (part of the character reference type): {| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"0\" | spell Gem[ # ] |The name of the spell in this slot# |} The part we're interested here is the first word spell which tells you what the return type of Gem[#] will be. In this case it will return a type \"spell\". Equal or NotEqual can only be used to compare two strings (which is why people would convert the result of ${Me.Gem[1]} (\"spell\") to a string by using the ${String} TLO). While this may look fine logically, it's not the way MQ2 Data Types were designed to be used, and its more work for your PC to convert the result of the spell to a string. The way you're supposed to use the Data Types is to add more members to the end of the TLO until you get the result you're looking for. In the above example, if we look at the reference type for spell , we see the following: {| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"0\" | string Name |Name |} This shows us that we can use the .Name reference type to get a string value as a result, which can then be compared (using .Equal or .NotEqual). So now we have a piece of code like the following: ${Me.Gem[1].Name} That will output a string value which contains the name of the spell in gem slot 1. The code: ${Me.Gem[1].Name.NotEqual[Complete Healing]} Will give us a TRUE/FALSE result if you echo the above statement. So instead of wrapping ${Me.Gem[1]} in a ${String[]} TLO, we've removed the need to convert the \"spell\" result to a \"string\" result, by adding .Name to the end of the TLO, thereby making it return a string value. The above changes can be incorporated into the initial faulty line, like this: /if (${Me.Gem[1].Name.NotEqual[Complete Healing]}) /memspell 1 \"Complete Healing\" We've now removed the ${String[]} part, and still have a perfectly functioning (and faster) macro. This macro I downloaded doesn't do X (fill in as appropriate) \u00b6 If you have followed all the advice in the General Macro Help section, and you are still having problems, you may want to post your problem to the macro thread itself. Follow the instructions in Help Forums but make sure to reply to the main macro post, and do not post a new thread in any of the other Help forums. If you have a feature request for your macro, post the request in the main macro thread and the macro writer may oblige you and add your requested feature.

In order to prevent people from using this TLO incorrectly, thus slowing down their macros, and in an attempt to teach people to create their macros properly and efficiently from the get-go, the ${String} TLO was removed. Finding this error when running a macro generally means you have an old copy of a macro. Most macros have been updated to not use the ${String} TLO and therefore the first place you should be looking is **in the forum thread where you obtained your macro**. Fixing the error is easy when you know what to look for, but a bit more tricky in a complicated macro or if you're not a macro maker yourself. Here's a simple example that should help explain it. The code: /if (${String[${Me.Gem[1]}].NotEqual[Complete Healing]}) /memspell 1 \"Complete Healing\" What this does is check if the spell name of the spell in the first slot is \"Complete Healing\" *(the /if statement inside the brackets) . If it is not, then mem \"Complete Healing\" in slot 1 (the /memspell bit after the brackets)*. If we look in the manual, we see the following entry for the Gem reference type (part of the character reference type): {| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"0\" | spell Gem[ # ] |The name of the spell in this slot# |} The part we're interested here is the first word spell which tells you what the return type of Gem[#] will be. In this case it will return a type \"spell\". Equal or NotEqual can only be used to compare two strings (which is why people would convert the result of ${Me.Gem[1]} (\"spell\") to a string by using the ${String} TLO). While this may look fine logically, it's not the way MQ2 Data Types were designed to be used, and its more work for your PC to convert the result of the spell to a string. The way you're supposed to use the Data Types is to add more members to the end of the TLO until you get the result you're looking for. In the above example, if we look at the reference type for spell , we see the following: {| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"0\" | string Name |Name |} This shows us that we can use the .Name reference type to get a string value as a result, which can then be compared (using .Equal or .NotEqual). So now we have a piece of code like the following: ${Me.Gem[1].Name} That will output a string value which contains the name of the spell in gem slot 1. The code: ${Me.Gem[1].Name.NotEqual[Complete Healing]} Will give us a TRUE/FALSE result if you echo the above statement. So instead of wrapping ${Me.Gem[1]} in a ${String[]} TLO, we've removed the need to convert the \"spell\" result to a \"string\" result, by adding .Name to the end of the TLO, thereby making it return a string value. The above changes can be incorporated into the initial faulty line, like this: /if (${Me.Gem[1].Name.NotEqual[Complete Healing]}) /memspell 1 \"Complete Healing\" We've now removed the ${String[]} part, and still have a perfectly functioning (and faster) macro.","title":"Due to complete misuse of the String Top-Level Object, it has been removed."},{"location":"macros/general-help/#this-macro-i-downloaded-doesnt-do-x-fill-in-as-appropriate","text":"If you have followed all the advice in the General Macro Help section, and you are still having problems, you may want to post your problem to the macro thread itself.

Variables in MQ2 are treated as Top-Level Objects . The basic syntax for accessing this MQ2Data is: ${TopLevelObject[index].Member[index].Member[index]} To access a property of a TLO you begin with the TLO type you want, then append successive type members or properties until you get the result you're looking for. The use of properties can become very complex (ie. extremely long), especially when using ${Math.Calc[]}. Note: You absolutely MUST pay attention to the return types of each member and object. Make sure to always compare identical Data Types when doing comparisons (eg. string to a string, or a numeric to a numeric). Using .Equal or .NotEqual to compare .Name to .ID will give errors. For example, \\({Target.Name.Equal[\\) ]} will not work. .Name returns a string, but .ID returns an int Also be sure to look at the To String of each type. Example of building an MQ2Data string: Suppose you want to display the distance to an NPC that you have targeted. First, check the page for TLO:Target . There you can see its forms listed as \" spawn Target \". This indicates that the Target TLO has access to all the spawn reference type members. Looking at the spawn reference type, you will find a list of the properties and members of spawn, to which Target has access to. Since you want to find the distance to the target, you would select one of the Distance members. For this example we will use: float Distance Distance from player in (x,y) So you append append .Distance to the TLO name to get: Target.Distance Once you have gotten to the information you want, you MUST enclose the entire string in ${ }, so the end result of the example would be: /echo Distance to target is: ${Target.Distance} This returns the distance to your target in the float format ###.## Note: All TLOs and reference data types have access to immediate types, but ensure you use the appropriate members of the immediate types with reference types or TLOs. For example, if you wanted to convert the above float value Distance, to an int value, you could append one of the members of the float immediate type, to make it: /echo Distance to target is: ${Target.Distance.Int} MQ2Data Members \u00b6 Members can also be describd as Properties or things that are property (owned by, contained by, etc) of objects of a type. For example, the Desk type of object might have a property called Screws . The Screws property itself might be represented like this: int Screws int is a type of object which means WHOLE NUMBER while Screws is the name of the object To demonstrate that an object named Screws is a member of the Desk type, we may also say: int Desk.Screws The return type is of the last member appended (ie. int). MQ2Data Inheritance \u00b6 Inheritance is a way to get less specific about what \"type\" of object you are looking at. For example, say you have two types, like desk and woodendesk . All wooden desks are desks, but not all desks are wooden desks. So now we have woodendesk ThisDesk Remember that \"desk\" we said has a member called Screws of type int . \"woodendesk\" IS a desk, so it automatically gets a member called Screws .

The default type is string. Names \u00b6 Only the following characters are allowed in the name of a variable: [a-z] A-Z [0-9]_ Name lookup is case insensitive. Manipulating Variables \u00b6 Declaring \u00b6 Variables are declared (initially defined) in the following format: /declare varname | varname [ array extents ] [ type ] [ local | global | outer ] [ defaultvalue ] The parameters must be given in order, but any after varname may be skipped to use the default. Some Examples This creates an int variable named MyVar that exists while the macro is running: /declare MyVar int outer This creates a string variable named MyVar that exists within the Sub it was created in: /declare MyVar local This creates a timer named MyTime that is set to 3000 at creation and exists while the macro is running: /declare MyTimer timer outer 3000 Arrays \u00b6 To create an array, attach square brackets to the end of the variable name and place in it the number of elements per dimension. Array Examples This creates a single-dimension local array of int with 10 elements (1-10) all 0: /declare MyArray[10] int This creates a 2-dimensional 10x10 elements(1-10,1-10) int array of scope outer with all values of 5: /declare MyArray[10,10] int outer 5 This creates a 3-dimensional array with 4x5x6 elements (1-4,1-5, 1-6) with UNDEFINED-ARRAY-ELEMENT in each location: /declare MyArray[4,5,6] string outer UNDEFINED-ARRAY-ELEMENT There is no limit to the number of dimensions or the number of elements in each dimension but use your own good judgment. Note: You cannot make an array of timers. Deleting Variables \u00b6 /deletevar is used to delete variables. Examples: Deletes the variable varname. Using * global will delete all global variables: /deletevar varname [* global] Sets a variable directly to a new value. Keep in mind that the type itself may reject this value depending on what you give it. /varset varname [newvalue] To clear the value of the variable, you may omit the new value. Setting/Changing Variables \u00b6 /varset is used to set or change a variable. Examples: This concatenates (joins one to the other) \"stuff\" to the end a string variable: /varset MyString ${MyString}stuff This inserts stuff at the front of ${MyString}: /varset MyString stuff${MyString} This sets MyInt to 123: /varset MyInt 123 This sets MyTimer to 123 seconds: /varset MyTimer 123s This sets MyFloat to 1.23: /varset MyFloat 1.23 This sets array element n to 123: /varset MyIntArray[n] 123 Setting Variables to Results of Calculations \u00b6 You can use /varcalc to set a variable directly to the numeric result of a calculation. Keep in mind that the type itself may reject this value depending on what you give it. This will NOT work on strings!

You will need to make the change to your ini file. Added looting, not tested but should work. Ini entry is useAutoLoot=TRUE/FALSE. Alias is /autoloot. I will put a link to the *Ninjadvloot thread later for those not familiar with it and it's ini file. Added anchor support, resets automatically when you get the followstop command. /anchor Added 3 commands to the chat event, gheal, hot me and patch me, if you had them in the buff section you should take them out now. Removed the Resplendent Cure code, just use the CureStuff section in the ini now and you will need to be running MQ2Debuffs plugin. I set up the sample ini's CureStuff section to work a little better. Updated for Stacks change and updated for the newest QuickBeg Cleaned up a lot of /if statements, lots left to do yet. Most likely other changes that I don't remember and this version is not fully tested so let me know if I screwed something up. May 21/07 Not sure what all I have done to this since it's last update but here is what I remember. UseWard should now work with named mobs, it should activate the Fervent Benediction and higher AA's. You should stand up after being hit with an FD spell. I changed the DoBuff routine so hopefully if asked for a group spell by more than one it should only cast it once. It is on a 2 minute timer before the next check for that spell, also resets if a different group spell is requested in that 2 minutes. It is not a great system but has helped so far by not looking as obvious by casting a group spell on the same group 2 or 3 times in a row. I changed the follow routine to use uw if you are underwater. If you zone into a water zone while following it will switch automatically but if following on land and then into water you will need to re-issue the follow command I was experimenting with Promised Renewal, the routine is still there and is hard coded to use gem8. I am not sure yet if I should just use the spell in place of complete healing or change my routine so it works better with it. Some new commands are: pop infusion will activate Infusion of the Faithful AA clickzone will click the nearest zone door book or whatever sayzone will target senders target and say the zone text example: /bc sayzone wish to go will target senders target and say wish to go (bugged, tank's target is temporary fix) Commands \u00b6 /anchor /echo Setting Anchor /autoloot /echo ToggleVar Auto Looting,useAutoLoot,Settings,useAutoLoot, /automok /echo ToggleVar Auto MoK,UseAutoMok,Settings,UseAutoMok, /automount /echo Toggling AutoMount /autostun /echo ToggleVar Auto Stun,UseAutoStun,Settings,UseAutoStun, /buffbeg /echo ToggleVar Buff Begging,BegForBuffs,Settings,BegForBuffs, /buffradius /echo ToggleString Setting NPC Buff Radius,NPCBuffRadius,Settings,NPCBuffRadius, /casterhot /echo ToggleString Setting Caster Hot Pct,CasterHotPoint,Heal_Percentages,CasterHotPoint, /casterpatch /echo ToggleString Setting Caster Patch Pct,CasterPatchPoint,Heal_Percentages,CasterPatchPoint, /dacast /echo ToggleString Setting DA Cast Point,DaCastPoint,Heal_Percentages,DaCastPoint, /defaultmt /echo ToggleString Setting Default MT,DefaultMT,Settings,DefaultMT, /doraidbuffs /echo ToggleVar Setting Raid Buffing,DoRaidBuffs,RaidBuffs,DoRaidBuffs, /divarb /echo ToggleString Setting Divine Arbitration Cast Point,DivArbPoint,Heal_Percentages,DivArbPoint, /dobufftells /echo ToggleVar Do Buff Tells,DoBuffTells,DoBuffStuff,DoBuffTells, /docures /echo ToggleVar Auto Curing,DoCures,CureStuff,DoCures, /donukes /echo ToggleVar Using Nukes,DoNuke,NukeStuff,DoNuke, /meleemode /echo ToggleVar Melee Mode,MeleeMode,Settings,MeleeMode, /necshmpatch /echo ToggleString Setting Nec Shm Patch Pct,NecShmPatchPoint,Heal_Percentages,NecShmPatchPoint, /nukeat /echo ToggleString Setting Nuke At,NukeAt,NukeStuff,NukeAt, /nukedelay /echo ToggleString Setting Nuke Delay,NukeDelay,NukeStuff,NukeDelay, /pethealpct /echo ToggleString Setting Pet Heal Pct,PetHealPoint,Pet_Settings,PetHealPoint, /useaura /echo ToggleVar Setting use aura,UseAura,SelfBuffStuff,UseAura, /useda /echo ToggleVar Setting use DA,UseDA,DAStuff,UseDA, /usehammer /echo ToggleVar Using Hammer,UseHammer,Settings,UseHammer, /usehot /echo ToggleVar Using HoT,UseHot,Settings,UseHot, /userenewal /echo ToggleVar Use Promised Renewal,UseRenewal,Settings,UseRenewal /useyaulp /echo Toggling UseYaulp /useward /echo ToggleVar Use Ward,UseWard,Settings,UseWard /secondtank /echo ToggleString Setting Second Tank,SecondTank,Settings,SecondTank, /selfhealpct /echo ToggleString Setting Self Heal Pct,SelfHealPoint,Heal_Percentages,SelfHealPoint, /tankhealpct /echo ToggleString Setting Tank Heal Pct,TankHealPoint,Heal_Percentages,TankHealPoint, /toggletank /echo Setting new main tank to: /turnundead /echo ToggleVar Setting Turn Undead,TurnUndead,Settings,TurnUndead, /healspell /echo ToggleString Setting Heal Spell,HealSpell,Spells,HealSpell, undeadskin - cast Sunskin gheal - cast groupheal hot me - cast hotspell patch me - cast patchheal invisoff - click off inviso buff pop infusion - cast infusion AA foeoff - click off Flight of Eeagles follow - start following toon that issued the command - toon has to be on master list follow stop - stop following a toon clickzone - click nearest zoneline (book, zonedoor, etc.) - has to be within distance of 12 sayzone - will target requestor's target and echo the following text sent with the command - currently uses tank's target (bugged, tank's target is temporary fix) mana check - report mana percent in channel slowcamp - sits and camps to desktop (fails if toon is on a mount) rezz me - will target and attempt to rezz the requestor's corpse, will use epic if available leaveraid - will disband you from a raid FAQ \u00b6 You can do /bc wod sym spell haste and it should cast them all in that order, usefull after rezzes and to do /bc mgb groupsym, can also be used this way to give more than one toon a command at the same time /bc focus symbolme p10 wod sayzone and clickzone this works nice now although I have not tried clickzone on every type of zone there is I did try a lot and it never failed. You will find a new entry in your ini files usually in the first section called ZoneDelay, this delay is for sayzone so that your whole grope doesn't /say all at the same time. You will want the person who initializes the command to have the longest delay, here is how I have mine set up Warrior 1 Cleric 10 Shaman 20 Druid 30 Enchanter 40 Ranger 50 So the warrior would say the text first, 1 second later the cleric would and every second after that another would until 5 seconds after giving the command my ranger would finaly say it. Nuking is automatic and the frequency depends on the NukeDelay that you set in the ini (can be changed on the fly with /nukedelay #). Look for the NukeStuff section in your ini. Also if you look at Sub Nuke there is a line that will return out of that sub when your tanks hp's are below 80% and as stated earlier in this thread you can lower that if you feel comfortable nuking at less than that The conditions for the macro to give the /sit command are: AutoSit has to be true, your mana % has to be less than what you have SitAt set to, your not on a mount, your not casting, you don't have your yaulp buff on, you don't have your divine avatar buff on, you are standing, the nearest NPC is farther away than you have DistanceToSit set at, your hit points are greater than 80% and you are not following. If any one of those conditions are not met the macro will not do the /sit. The only other times /sit is used is right after a rezz and that should keep you sitting until you have 500 mana. The other time is if you give the slowcamp command. The Moked event works perfectly. It does have some strict conditions, first you need to have the spell memmed and it has to be ready to cast, second your tank needs to be 90% or higher hps and third the mob has to be above 75% not to mention the macro has to be free to run the event and not in another function like healing someone in the group or whatever and your cleric needs to be able to see the DS spam. If all those conditions are true it will work every time. If you want to change the conditions edit Sub Event_DamageShield but it has worked for me the way it is for almost 2 years. The mob you are fighting has to have a DS in order to for Sub Event_DamageShield to be triggered, here are the 3 trigger lines event DamageShield \"#1# was burned#*#\" event DamageShield \"#1# was pierced by#*#\" event DamageShield \"#1# was tormented#*#\" can I use | to set up multiple tanks to watch? It will only watch 1 tank the way it is set up and the tank doesn't need to be in your group. It would be able to watch 1 tank out of it's group and would also try to heal any in it's group in modes 2 and 3 and if they are a war, shd or pal it would try to use HealSpell first.

Added hammer routine. Apr.19/07 Spell section in the ini file now requires Gem#, item or alt for all gems except YaulpSpellGem and NukeOneGem, will change them in the next update. You will need to make the change to your ini file. Added looting, not tested but should work. Ini entry is useAutoLoot=TRUE/FALSE. Alias is /autoloot. I will put a link to the *Ninjadvloot thread later for those not familiar with it and it's ini file. Added anchor support, resets automatically when you get the followstop command. /anchor Added 3 commands to the chat event, gheal, hot me and patch me, if you had them in the buff section you should take them out now. Removed the Resplendent Cure code, just use the CureStuff section in the ini now and you will need to be running MQ2Debuffs plugin. I set up the sample ini's CureStuff section to work a little better. Updated for Stacks change and updated for the newest QuickBeg Cleaned up a lot of /if statements, lots left to do yet. Most likely other changes that I don't remember and this version is not fully tested so let me know if I screwed something up. May 21/07 Not sure what all I have done to this since it's last update but here is what I remember. UseWard should now work with named mobs, it should activate the Fervent Benediction and higher AA's. You should stand up after being hit with an FD spell. I changed the DoBuff routine so hopefully if asked for a group spell by more than one it should only cast it once. It is on a 2 minute timer before the next check for that spell, also resets if a different group spell is requested in that 2 minutes. It is not a great system but has helped so far by not looking as obvious by casting a group spell on the same group 2 or 3 times in a row. I changed the follow routine to use uw if you are underwater. If you zone into a water zone while following it will switch automatically but if following on land and then into water you will need to re-issue the follow command I was experimenting with Promised Renewal, the routine is still there and is hard coded to use gem8. I am not sure yet if I should just use the spell in place of complete healing or change my routine so it works better with it. Some new commands are: pop infusion will activate Infusion of the Faithful AA clickzone will click the nearest zone door book or whatever sayzone will target senders target and say the zone text example: /bc sayzone wish to go will target senders target and say wish to go (bugged, tank's target is temporary fix)","title":"Updates"},{"location":"macros/gallery/afcleric.mac-nils/#commands","text":"/anchor /echo Setting Anchor /autoloot /echo ToggleVar Auto Looting,useAutoLoot,Settings,useAutoLoot, /automok /echo ToggleVar Auto MoK,UseAutoMok,Settings,UseAutoMok, /automount /echo Toggling AutoMount /autostun /echo ToggleVar Auto Stun,UseAutoStun,Settings,UseAutoStun, /buffbeg /echo ToggleVar Buff Begging,BegForBuffs,Settings,BegForBuffs, /buffradius /echo ToggleString Setting NPC Buff Radius,NPCBuffRadius,Settings,NPCBuffRadius, /casterhot /echo ToggleString Setting Caster Hot Pct,CasterHotPoint,Heal_Percentages,CasterHotPoint, /casterpatch /echo ToggleString Setting Caster Patch Pct,CasterPatchPoint,Heal_Percentages,CasterPatchPoint, /dacast /echo ToggleString Setting DA Cast Point,DaCastPoint,Heal_Percentages,DaCastPoint, /defaultmt /echo ToggleString Setting Default MT,DefaultMT,Settings,DefaultMT, /doraidbuffs /echo ToggleVar Setting Raid Buffing,DoRaidBuffs,RaidBuffs,DoRaidBuffs, /divarb /echo ToggleString Setting Divine Arbitration Cast Point,DivArbPoint,Heal_Percentages,DivArbPoint, /dobufftells /echo ToggleVar Do Buff Tells,DoBuffTells,DoBuffStuff,DoBuffTells, /docures /echo ToggleVar Auto Curing,DoCures,CureStuff,DoCures, /donukes /echo ToggleVar Using Nukes,DoNuke,NukeStuff,DoNuke, /meleemode /echo ToggleVar Melee Mode,MeleeMode,Settings,MeleeMode, /necshmpatch /echo ToggleString Setting Nec Shm Patch Pct,NecShmPatchPoint,Heal_Percentages,NecShmPatchPoint, /nukeat /echo ToggleString Setting Nuke At,NukeAt,NukeStuff,NukeAt, /nukedelay /echo ToggleString Setting Nuke Delay,NukeDelay,NukeStuff,NukeDelay, /pethealpct /echo ToggleString Setting Pet Heal Pct,PetHealPoint,Pet_Settings,PetHealPoint, /useaura /echo ToggleVar Setting use aura,UseAura,SelfBuffStuff,UseAura, /useda /echo ToggleVar Setting use DA,UseDA,DAStuff,UseDA, /usehammer /echo ToggleVar Using Hammer,UseHammer,Settings,UseHammer, /usehot /echo ToggleVar Using HoT,UseHot,Settings,UseHot, /userenewal /echo ToggleVar Use Promised Renewal,UseRenewal,Settings,UseRenewal /useyaulp /echo Toggling UseYaulp /useward /echo ToggleVar Use Ward,UseWard,Settings,UseWard /secondtank /echo ToggleString Setting Second Tank,SecondTank,Settings,SecondTank, /selfhealpct /echo ToggleString Setting Self Heal Pct,SelfHealPoint,Heal_Percentages,SelfHealPoint, /tankhealpct /echo ToggleString Setting Tank Heal Pct,TankHealPoint,Heal_Percentages,TankHealPoint, /toggletank /echo Setting new main tank to: /turnundead /echo ToggleVar Setting Turn Undead,TurnUndead,Settings,TurnUndead, /healspell /echo ToggleString Setting Heal Spell,HealSpell,Spells,HealSpell, undeadskin - cast Sunskin gheal - cast groupheal hot me - cast hotspell patch me - cast patchheal invisoff - click off inviso buff pop infusion - cast infusion AA foeoff - click off Flight of Eeagles follow - start following toon that issued the command - toon has to be on master list follow stop - stop following a toon clickzone - click nearest zoneline (book, zonedoor, etc.) - has to be within distance of 12 sayzone - will target requestor's target and echo the following text sent with the command - currently uses tank's target (bugged, tank's target is temporary fix) mana check - report mana percent in channel slowcamp - sits and camps to desktop (fails if toon is on a mount) rezz me - will target and attempt to rezz the requestor's corpse, will use epic if available leaveraid - will disband you from a raid","title":"Commands"},{"location":"macros/gallery/afcleric.mac-nils/#faq","text":"You can do /bc wod sym spell haste and it should cast them all in that order, usefull after rezzes and to do /bc mgb groupsym, can also be used this way to give more than one toon a command at the same time /bc focus symbolme p10 wod sayzone and clickzone this works nice now although I have not tried clickzone on every type of zone there is I did try a lot and it never failed.

This wiki includes many updates/changes done by Gomer,gSe7eN,trevyn,Warlock45,and others. Requirements \u00b6 AutoBot.mac does not run on a default MQ compilation, it has a few extra dependencies. Some of the below items are plugins and need to be compiled, just like MacroQuest2. Please read the appropriate documentation for each plugin. The Include files should be added to the same directory that AutoBot will be run from. Plugins: MQ2MoveUtils by Outlander This is so the macro knows about stick, /makecamp, and /moveto. Check out the wiki . MQ2Exchange by Wassup This is so that item swapping, casting, and swapping back will work MQ2Debuffs by pinkfloydx33 This is so the macro can keep track of your debuff counters. MQ2Melee by s0rcier So as to properly configure melee/ranged combat and various options thereof, check out the wiki . *Optional: MQ2AutoLogin to change to your trader Includes Files: Wait4Rez.inc Handles pre-rez situations. spell_routines.inc Handles spell casting, from gems, items and AAs. QuickBeg2.inc Handles buff begging. Ninjadvloot.inc Handles looting. Defense.inc Handles automatic engagement of defensive disc/aa/items for tanks. AAPurchase.incHandles automatic purchase of AA based on INI entries. Getting Started \u00b6 Pointers for AutoBot stuffs. (We should make a multi-boxing wiki sometime, we could link it here...) In addition to the documentation for the various plugins used directly by AutoBot (see links in Requirements ) The following is useful info on other plugins you can use to enhance your AutoBot experience. MQ2Clip by Vaft, Cr4zyb4rd, et al. Manages the clip plane of backgrounded sessions. Your CPU will thank you. MQ2FPS by Lax. Helps manage framerates of EQ sessions, greatly helps multi-botting... Check out the wiki MQ2Eqbc by Omnictrl Is an alternative way to communicate with your bots. Configure your EQBC.ini with the following: [Last Connect] Server=192.168.1.101 (This must be edited to match the ip and port you have the server listening to) Port=2112 [Settings] AutoConnect=1 AllowControl=1 You will also need to change the channel setting in your AutoBot.ini from \"i say\" to \"bc\" to use it for bot to bot communication. Don't forget that if you are getting identify spam that you check loot.ini and QB2Settings.ini for any i say or i msg commands. QB2Settings.ini defaults to i msg and needs to be changed if using EQBC. Recommend MQ2NetBots , MQ2NetStat , and MQ2NetHeal to go along with this. More information available on Page 59 of the original AutoBot thread. Using AutoBot.mac \u00b6 1) The main macro file, 'yyy.mac' (called 'RaidDruid.mac' in the .zip file) can be named to 'AutoBot.mac' or 'AnythingYouWant.mac'. 2) To start the macro in EverQuest with MQ2 running; type '/macro yyy.mac Note: The first time you run the macro, it will generate an ini file called RD_xxx.ini 3) Configure your RD_xxx.ini, where 'xxx' is your character name. 3a) Peruse through RDCommon.ini and add in any mobs you might want to have certains spells ignore. I tend to put Guild Lobby and PoK NPCs as immune to mez, makes life simpler when walking around and I forget to pause my bots. You will also find the MasterList here. 4)Restart Autobot after configuring RD_xxx.ini. 5) Enjoy the show. Bot Commands \u00b6 There are a few non-alias (no / required) commands available to Autobot. These commands will cause the bots to respond to a few general status/movement commands without the obvious /alias, for easy use in a group setting. Bots will only respond to commands sent by someone in the MasterList buffqueue This command has your bot respond in your ChatChannel with the # of buffs left in his \"buff queue\". Handy for deciding whether to continue pulling/crawling after a group wipe. Keep in mind that some longer cast spells such as Night's Dark Terror for enchanters have extremely long recast times, and so can sit in the queue for a while. break This will make your bots visible (they will click off all invisibility or IVU buffs). camp here This command will cause any other toons using Autobot to utilize MQ2Moveutil's \"make camp\" function, using he location coordinates you are standing on when issuing the command. follow This command will have your bots /stick to you. They will sit to med if needed and within your LeashLength. They will also break off to attack if /domelee is turned on and the MA is fighting something. They will also service buff requests and do debuffing if applicable and they are not moving. guard here Those toons you have the Guard function turned on will utilize MQ2MoveUtils camp function to set up a tightly controlled camp radius where that character is currently standing. mana All bots with a mana pool bigger than 0 will report their current % mana in your /chatchannel. medtime All bots with a mana pool bigger than 0 will report their currently estimated time to full mana based on their current Mana Regen divided by their mana level. move up This command tells your bots to move up to your current location. If they are set to /makecamp, they will reset their camp X and Y loc to your current position. If they are following, they will resume following once they reach your position (This is handy for positioning your bots in front of doors/bridges before moving through/across them) stop This command tells the bots to stop following wherever they happen to be standing. use keyword XXX YYY This command will cause the toon to say the keyword XXX to target YYY. Example: \"use keyword when gribble\" who has XXXX This command will have the toon check their inventory for the item. It will announce in the chat channel if it is in your bank, bags, top level inventory, or a worn item. If the item is an augment and mounted, it will say what item the augments is in. Send me to XXXXX This will cause a listening wizard or druid to cast zehphyr/translocate XXX on the requester, uses same keywords as portto portto XXXXX This will cause your wizard or druid bot to port using their group port spells, provided they have them in their spellbook. Current accepted keywords are: Druid alra arcstone barindu blightfire brell buriedsea butcher cobalt commons combine dawnshroud direwild domain east (karana) emerald (jungle) feerrott greatdivide grimling grounds karana (north) iceclad lavastorm Lceanium loping misty moors natimbi nexus pok ro shards skyfire south (emerald jungle) steamfont steppes stonebrunt succor surefall tempest time tox twilight undershore wakening Wizard: alra arcstone barindu bloodfield brell cazic cobalt combine|dreadlands commons dawnshroud dragonscale ej|emerald (emerald jungle) gfay (greater faydark) gd|greatdivide grimling grounds karana (north) katta iceclad icefall Lceanium moors (blightfire moors) natimbi nek nexus nro pok|knowledge sarith skyfire shards slaughter sro sunderock time tox twilight twk|west karana (ethernere tainted west karana) undershore wakening wkarna succor Slash Commands \u00b6 AutoBot.mac comes with a great set of predefined Slash Commands for easy and fast in-game configuration. Uber macro pause/unpause hotkey (bound to for me, unlike normal EQ hotkeys 1-10, it works even while casting) Add the following lines to MQ2CustomBinds .txt: name=StartPauseDB down=/docommand ${If[!${Macro.Name.Equal[RaidDruid.mac]}, /mac RaidDruid.mac, /varset RDPause ${If[${RDPause}==1,0,1]}]} up= Then in game type _/bind StartPauseDB _ to bind that to your __ key. When pressed your __ key will start AutoBot if it's not already started. If it's already running it will toggle the pause on the macro. Here's a full list, divided into sub-sections for each category of Slash Commands there are (Each toggle alias works by itself, or will take an argument of ON/OFF, TRUE/FALSE, or 1/0): Melee \u00b6 /dodefense Toggles usage of the defensive measures in Defense.inc (currently only works for SK,PAL, and WAR) /domelee Toggles automatic engaging of the MA's target in melee.(Must have the plugin MQ2Melee configured properly) /domercassist Toggles whether you want the macro to engage mercenaries (so you can better control when they engage) /domercstance Toggles automatic changing of the bot's mercenary stance based on if the MA's target is named (or higher level) or mercenary's aggro /doranged Toggles automatic engaging of /autofire if MA's target is with in NPCradius and beyond range distance /mercengagehps Set the HP% you want the macro to engage your mercenaries, if you have /domercassist on /guard Toggles the guard function on|off /rangedist XXX set the minimum distance away from mob before engaging /autofire. The EQ minumum is 30. /reportdefense Toggles reporting for Defense.inc events /status This will toggle the group \"status\" checking part of the guard function, allowing the guard toon to pause for group members below 50mana or 30endurance, for 60 second per check. /stickarg XXX sets melee arguments for stick during fights General \u00b6 /addalert ${Target.CleanName} Adds targetted NPC to the list which will be ignored in the RDCommon.ini and will perform normally when near these npc's not treating them as hostile. ${Target.CleanName} can also be replaced with the name of the mob typed out or the ini file can be manually edited. /assistdelay Sets the amount of time the bot will wait between MA assists. (Ex. /assistdelay 5s) /assistma Toggles assisting of your designated MA1, MA2, and MA3. Turning this off essentially disables Melee, Nuking, DoTing, and Debuffing /autoninja Toggles auto looting of the nearest corpse after each XP gained message. Will only loot droppable items. Must have the plugin MQ2MoveUtils for this to work. /autosit Toggles auto sitting to med. Not much to say here. /changetank Toggles automatic changing to MA2 or MA3 when MA1 dies (need to have /usegroupassist and /useraidassist both off, still testing) /chatchannel Sets the chat channel the bot reports to, (Ex. /chatchannel \"i say\"\ufffd) /docanni Toggles auto casting of your cannibalization spell when below your MedPct and above your CanniHPs. Also works for wizard harvest, mana robe, and necromancer Lich spells. **/doports**Toggles whether your druid or wizard bot will respond to portto comands /doyaulp Toggles auto casting of your yaulp spell when below your MedPct and there are NPCs within your NPCRadius. /engagehps Sets the % of the mobs HPs you want to start melee/debuffing/dotting/nuking (Ex. /engagehps 95) /ma1 Assigns a PC as Main Assist 1. (Ex. /ma1 BoDuke) /ma2 Assigns a PC as Main Assist 2. (Ex. /ma2 LukeDuke) /ma3 Assigns a PC as Main Assist 3. (Ex. /ma3 DaisyDuke) /leashlength Sets the distance your bot will allow itself to get from his follow target before resuming follow (Ex. /leashlength 25) /listspells Returns a list of all configured Spell Sets in your ini. /loadini \"IniFileName\" Loads a pre-configured ini file. /medpct Sets the % of Mana you want to sit or summon your horse at. (Ex. /medpct 50) /npcradchk Sets the Radius (in feet) around you that defines how close mobs are allow before you stop buffing to avoid aggro (Ex. /npcradchk 100) /npcradius Sets the Radius (in feet) around you that you want to watch NPCs using Assist healing and Assisting the MA (Ex. /npcradius 200) /npczradius Sets the Radius (in feet) above/below you that you want to watch NPCs using Assist healing and Assisting the MA (Ex. /npczradius 200) /rdpause Toggles AutoBot's active functions on and off. /relaytells Toggles automatic reporting of tells sent to the bot in your configured /chatchannel /reportevents Toggles automatic reporting of your bot's status messages such as low food/drink, stunned/unstunned, encumbered, etc. /reportmana Toggles automatic reporting of your mana status if you get below the medpct, only reports once before going above the medpct. /reportmanapct Defines the point at which you want to start reporting your mana status to your chat channel. /reporttoggles Toggles automatic reporting of your toggle status of any /commands you send your bot in the ChatChannel. /reportwow Toggles automatic reporting of Wrath of the Wild on the MA /saveini \"IniFileName\" Creates an ini file named \"IniFileName\" /sitdelay Sets the amount of time you want to wait before sitting after casting any spell that might be considered aggro. (Ex. /sitdelay 5s) /stophps Sets the % of the mob's HPs you want to stop nuking and debuffing.

This creates an array of every PC within PCRadius, and cycles through every one of them, checking their HPs against your defined HealPct, and casts heals if appropriate. Super handy on mobs with AE Rampage or AE Damage effects. /assistheal Toggles on Assist Healing. This creates an array of every NPC within NPCRadius, and assists them to find the target of their aggression, and heals that target if necessary. Super handy for general clearing on raids before getting to named. Also causes target to constantly ping-pong wildly all over the place trying to find a target to heal /cancelpct Set this to the percentage of HPs you want AutoBot to cancel heals at. (Ex. /cancelpct 90) /checkgroup Sets the number of seconds you'd like to wait between HP evaluations /delayedhealpct XX Sets the percentage of HPs to cast delayed heal on MA1 /divarbhps Sets the % HPs you want to cast Divine Arbitration at if a groupmember gets below it (Ex. /divarbhps 25) /dointerrupting Toggles interrupting debuffs/nukes/dots to heal group members. Some people like to just let their group members die instead of ducking a nuke to heal them. This is for those people! /doretort Toggles automatic casting of the listed Retort spell on MA1 /doward Toggles automatic casting of the listed Ward spell on MA1 /healchannel Sets the channel your bots use to report heals when they are cast. /healfd Toggles healing of FD classes (SK, Necro, Monk) only while they are FD (Ex. /healfd ON will only heal if they are FD) /healgroup Toggles healing of your group. With this on, it will heal groupmembers that are below HealPct /healmefirst Toggles healing of yourself over any group members. If you are mid-cast to heal someone else and your HPs fall below the HealPct, you will cancel it and heal yourself first. Self preservation at its finest. /healpct Sets the % of HPs you want to heal other PCs at. (ex. /healpct 70) /healpets Toggles healing of any pets in the group if they are below the PetHealPct /healramp Toggles automatic healing of your Rampage tank anytime a RAMPAGE message is detected. /healxtarget Toggles activation of healing PC and pets on the extended target window. /pcradius Sets the Radius (in feet) around you that you want to watch PC HPs using AE healing (Ex. /pcradius 200) /pczradius Sets the Radius (in feet) above and below you that you want to watch PC HPs using AE healing (Ex. /pczradius 50) /pethealpct Sets the % of HPs you will heal pets at. (Ex. /pethealpct 40) /ramptank Sets the Rampage Tank that you check whenever a RAMPAGE message is seen with /healramp on. (Ex. /ramptank UncleJesse) /reportheals Toggles automatic reporting of heals in the ChatChannel /reportinterrupts Toggles automatic reporting of interrupts to heal in the ChatChannel /reportsotw Toggles automatic reporting of Spirit of the Wood in the ChatChannel /sotw Toggle auto casting of Spirit of the Wood /sotwpct Set this to the average group HP percentage you want it to auto cast Spirit of the Wood at. (Ex. /sotwpct 75) /tankhealpct Sets the % you start Chealing. Due to some predictive logic the Cheal may start earlier. Set this to the abslute floor you want to start CH at. /usech Toggles using your Cheal spell on MA1 on or off. It will monitor the tank's HPs and if he's taking enough damage to be dead in less than 20 seconds, it will duck out of whatever RD is currently doing and start a CH. If the tank's HPs stop falling and level off above the TankHealPct, it will cancel CH and wait until the tank's HPs fall again. /usedelayed Toggles casting the listed Delayed Heal on MA1 /usedivarb Toggles using your divine arbitration or cleric epic 1.5 (if you have it) when a group member falls below the DivArbHPs. /usetankhot Toggles casting the listed Heal over Time spell on MA1 /waittocancel Toggle. When turned on, this will wait until your heals have less than .5 seconds left before making the decison to cancel the heal. Buffing \u00b6 AutoBot queues buff requests and casts them when appropriate. It will not cast buffs unless there are no mobs within 20 feet of the bot, it's not in combat, and it's not moving. It will hold onto those buff requests until you are no longer moving, not in combat, and there are no mobs within 20 feet. If you zone, all stored buffs are flushed, and you have to beg again. By default the bot only listens for /tells and IRC chat for buffing. If you want him to listen in other channels, you need to add #chat group to listen in group, or #chat chat to listen in EQ's chat channels; to the RaidDruid.mac file under the #chat tell line right near the top of the macro. More information on the #chat function can be found in the MacroQuest manual . Aliases: /buff \"Spell Name/Alias\" [Name | Group] Use this alias to send a buff command to your bot, will also accept buff aliases. You can use this to cast items and AAs as well as spells. If you specify Group instead of a name, it will buff your whole group with that spell, if it is a single target spell. In addition, you can cast it on any spawn including NPCs, Pets, Corpses, etc. (Ex. /buff \"Steeloak Skin\"\ufffd Bob, or /buff Oak Bob if oak is an alias for steeloak skin). If the /buff command utilizes a DoBuff alias, the buff request is queued and will not be performed during combat. If the Spell/AA/item name itself is used in the /buff command it is cast immediately.

Lastly make sure that the alias's are correct. in the example ini's it looks like this \"| convicton | viction | convic |\", however if you have it set up like that, the buff requester for all intents and purposes needs to put that word in a sentence. if you have the ini looking like this \"|convicton|viction|convic|\" with no spaces in between the \" | \" then the bot will reconize and ackowlege any tell that has any of the word alias's it sees. On Bot will assist but wont engage when set to The bigest thing you do to fix that is increase the NPCRadius=120, Also, consider verifiying, and tweaking the following as well. NPCZRadius=120, AssistMA=TRUE, , DoMelee=TRUE, AssistDelay=0s, MA1=Chuck_Norris, EngageHPs=101. aso remember that other options may be fighting for servicing. looting, selfbuffing, debuffing, buffing, etc.. so if melee is priority, turn everything but assisting off. also make sure that mq2melee is set up right. type /melee to bring up its console and see whats set and whats not. same thing goes. if your not a pet class turn off all that other stuff to prevent any chance of conflicts. On Cant load selo's into the ini Selos uses a \"````````````\" located to the left of the 1 key. On incorrectly mezed Targets (also known as: Oh why does my chanter mez my MA's target?) You need to properly set the target for the BOT by the Leader AA, or /varset MATarget ${Target.ID} as explained in \"On target acquisition\" On automatically mezzing NPCs when you don't want to Set /rdpause on the BOT you want to stop auto debuffing (rdpause stops all automatic activity), type \"/rdpause on\" \\(minus quotes\\) into your command channel to stop auto-activity on multiple BOT's at once, or add the NPC you wish to not mez to the immune/ignore list in RDCommon.ini. You will need to know the spell ID for the spell you wish not to cast and this can be found by ${Spell[My Mez Spell Name Here].ID} (Use /echo in front of ${Spell[My Mez Spell Name Here].ID} if your typing it in EQ) On Target acquisition AutoBot acquires the Main Assist's (MA) target in a number of ways. 1) By setting the MA in the bot's ini file and the assist delay, the macro will attempt to acquire the target of the MA after the set time. 2) By assigning the role Main Assist to someone in your group, the bot will acquire the MA's target that way. (if /udegroupassist or /usegroupma is on) 3) By assigning the role Main Tank to someone in your group, the bot will aquire the MT's target. (if /usegrouptank is on) 4) By manually setting the MA's target using /varset MATarget ${Target.ID} in whatever channel your bots listen to commands in. 5) By using \"/useraidassist\" or \"/useraidma\" (remember to turn off /usegroupma and /usegrouptank if you do this) the macro will aquire a target assist the raids main assist (Raid Assist 1) On non-working clickies If you have a clicky with no recast timer that isn't working. (Such as Time's Antithesis, Veil of Lost Hopes, et al...) The odds are you have an old version of MQ2. As of the 20 th of Dec Zip, these issues have been fixed. if you don't know what version of the zip you have, try simply running /echo ${FindItem[item name].Timer} and seeing what value it returns. Anything other than zero is Bad(tm) and denotes an out-of-date zip file. Update, update, update! Also your last inventory slot must NOT be a bag. Clickies usable from inventory, even if usable in other slots, will be used from base inventory slot 8. On chain-casting clickies or buffs Often times this is due to misspelling something in the INI file, or it can be the resulting buff icon differs from the spell icon in some manner. You will note there is now an \"Icon\" entry for buffs. Carefully double check the actual name of the buff ingame and match the INI to it. On out-of-date alias lists If you are attempting to reload your alias to your macroquest.ini. You must remove the Version=X.XX from RD_common.ini. Doing this will make the Version mismatch appear and reload all the alias's On healing not working On heals that never cancel even though target's health goes above CancelPct Tankheal must be defined as a valid spell and different than FastHeal=, even if you are not using Tankheals (UseCH setting). On Green (non-XP) corpses that are not auto looted These are not looted automatically. To trigger looting, at any time, send your bot \"You gain party experience!\" in whatever channel it is set to monitor. On late/not reliable buffs Bots will not buff in combat. Also it will not sit to memorize buffs if a NPC is within a certain range, although using a horse remedies this. On non-refreshing buffs on bots themselves Buffs from the [DoBuffStuff] or buff command are not rebuffed on the same bot that cast them, because you dont get a buff wear off message when they wear off yourself. If you want certain buffs kept up on your bot, you should use [SelfBuffStuff] section. On bots that keep targeting some npc, even though it hasn't been told it to assist and kill it Your MA could have a corpse close, and that is being assisted to get a target. Or you could be using an old version of autobot. On non-following bots Target someone and type /stick. If that doesnt work you have issues with MQ2MoveUtils . On Clerics that spam Complete Heals and interrupt them all Make sure you have UseDivArb set to 0 if you dont have that AA. // There's more to this than just the DivArb setting... but this might be one issue\\ On non-attacking pets/bots Check your MQ2Melee settings(the wiki for it is here ). You need a properly configured MQ2Melee for your pets/bots to attack and do other various melee-related tasks. On items being identified You aren't using the IRC plugin. By default /i is mapped to /identify. No slash commands work or error: \"DoCommand - Couldn't parse '/...' \" This usually happens when you update MQ2 and overwrite the macroquest.ini file. This file contains all the aliases (ie. the slash commands). To fix, delete the Version=X.XX line in RD_Common.ini, which will write all the aliases back to the macroquest.ini file when you restart Autobot. In general, you do not need to overwrite the Macroquest.ini file when updating MQ2. When your bot doesn't mem spells Your ini is set up wrong. Your XXXXGem#= entry needs to read \"gem#\", not just #. At least, 9 times out of 10 that's the problem. Check one of the sample ini files for an example. On My bots dont aquire targets when everything is set up properly Each toon needs a breastplate, it has to do with the way autobot checks deaths and runs the auto accept rez feature, it also disables assisting, for a good reason...","title":"AutoBot.mac-V4.28+"},{"location":"macros/gallery/autobot.mac-v4.28%2B/#autobotmac-v428","text":"","title":"AutoBot.mac-V4.28+"},{"location":"macros/gallery/autobot.mac-v4.28%2B/#description","text":"AutoBot.mac by A_Druid_00 is a versatile macro for automating a lot of tasks for your character in group, raid and solo situations.

Handy for deciding whether to continue pulling/crawling after a group wipe. Keep in mind that some longer cast spells such as Night's Dark Terror for enchanters have extremely long recast times, and so can sit in the queue for a while. break This will make your bots visible (they will click off all invisibility or IVU buffs). camp here This command will cause any other toons using Autobot to utilize MQ2Moveutil's \"make camp\" function, using he location coordinates you are standing on when issuing the command. follow This command will have your bots /stick to you. They will sit to med if needed and within your LeashLength. They will also break off to attack if /domelee is turned on and the MA is fighting something. They will also service buff requests and do debuffing if applicable and they are not moving. guard here Those toons you have the Guard function turned on will utilize MQ2MoveUtils camp function to set up a tightly controlled camp radius where that character is currently standing. mana All bots with a mana pool bigger than 0 will report their current % mana in your /chatchannel. medtime All bots with a mana pool bigger than 0 will report their currently estimated time to full mana based on their current Mana Regen divided by their mana level. move up This command tells your bots to move up to your current location.

Check to see the MaxMobs=5 is appropraite to the number of NPC's around you. Monsters that are green or sitting/laying down will never be debuffed/dotted. On Buff requests not being serviced Unless you indicate that you want the buff executed in combat the bot will not service the buff if there are NPC's nearby. You can have the macro ignore certain npcs that we know for certain arnt kos by adding their names in the RDCommon.ini .Alternatly the NPC check radius is adjustable in the ini. Also make sure that the buff name is spelled correctly just how it looks in the info window. Lastly make sure that the alias's are correct. in the example ini's it looks like this \"| convicton | viction | convic |\", however if you have it set up like that, the buff requester for all intents and purposes needs to put that word in a sentence. if you have the ini looking like this \"|convicton|viction|convic|\" with no spaces in between the \" | \" then the bot will reconize and ackowlege any tell that has any of the word alias's it sees. On Bot will assist but wont engage when set to The bigest thing you do to fix that is increase the NPCRadius=120, Also, consider verifiying, and tweaking the following as well. NPCZRadius=120, AssistMA=TRUE, , DoMelee=TRUE, AssistDelay=0s, MA1=Chuck_Norris, EngageHPs=101. aso remember that other options may be fighting for servicing. looting, selfbuffing, debuffing, buffing, etc.. so if melee is priority, turn everything but assisting off. also make sure that mq2melee is set up right. type /melee to bring up its console and see whats set and whats not. same thing goes. if your not a pet class turn off all that other stuff to prevent any chance of conflicts. On Cant load selo's into the ini Selos uses a \"````````````\" located to the left of the 1 key. On incorrectly mezed Targets (also known as: Oh why does my chanter mez my MA's target?) You need to properly set the target for the BOT by the Leader AA, or /varset MATarget ${Target.ID} as explained in \"On target acquisition\" On automatically mezzing NPCs when you don't want to Set /rdpause on the BOT you want to stop auto debuffing (rdpause stops all automatic activity), type \"/rdpause on\" \\(minus quotes\\) into your command channel to stop auto-activity on multiple BOT's at once, or add the NPC you wish to not mez to the immune/ignore list in RDCommon.ini. You will need to know the spell ID for the spell you wish not to cast and this can be found by ${Spell[My Mez Spell Name Here].ID} (Use /echo in front of ${Spell[My Mez Spell Name Here].ID} if your typing it in EQ) On Target acquisition AutoBot acquires the Main Assist's (MA) target in a number of ways. 1) By setting the MA in the bot's ini file and the assist delay, the macro will attempt to acquire the target of the MA after the set time. 2) By assigning the role Main Assist to someone in your group, the bot will acquire the MA's target that way. (if /udegroupassist or /usegroupma is on) 3) By assigning the role Main Tank to someone in your group, the bot will aquire the MT's target. (if /usegrouptank is on) 4) By manually setting the MA's target using /varset MATarget ${Target.ID} in whatever channel your bots listen to commands in. 5) By using \"/useraidassist\" or \"/useraidma\" (remember to turn off /usegroupma and /usegrouptank if you do this) the macro will aquire a target assist the raids main assist (Raid Assist 1) On non-working clickies If you have a clicky with no recast timer that isn't working. (Such as Time's Antithesis, Veil of Lost Hopes, et al...) The odds are you have an old version of MQ2. As of the 20 th of Dec Zip, these issues have been fixed. if you don't know what version of the zip you have, try simply running /echo ${FindItem[item name].Timer} and seeing what value it returns. Anything other than zero is Bad(tm) and denotes an out-of-date zip file. Update, update, update! Also your last inventory slot must NOT be a bag. Clickies usable from inventory, even if usable in other slots, will be used from base inventory slot 8. On chain-casting clickies or buffs Often times this is due to misspelling something in the INI file, or it can be the resulting buff icon differs from the spell icon in some manner. You will note there is now an \"Icon\" entry for buffs. Carefully double check the actual name of the buff ingame and match the INI to it. On out-of-date alias lists If you are attempting to reload your alias to your macroquest.ini. You must remove the Version=X.XX from RD_common.ini. Doing this will make the Version mismatch appear and reload all the alias's On healing not working On heals that never cancel even though target's health goes above CancelPct Tankheal must be defined as a valid spell and different than FastHeal=, even if you are not using Tankheals (UseCH setting). On Green (non-XP) corpses that are not auto looted These are not looted automatically. To trigger looting, at any time, send your bot \"You gain party experience!\" in whatever channel it is set to monitor. On late/not reliable buffs Bots will not buff in combat. Also it will not sit to memorize buffs if a NPC is within a certain range, although using a horse remedies this. On non-refreshing buffs on bots themselves Buffs from the [DoBuffStuff] or buff command are not rebuffed on the same bot that cast them, because you dont get a buff wear off message when they wear off yourself. If you want certain buffs kept up on your bot, you should use [SelfBuffStuff] section. On bots that keep targeting some npc, even though it hasn't been told it to assist and kill it Your MA could have a corpse close, and that is being assisted to get a target. Or you could be using an old version of autobot. On non-following bots Target someone and type /stick. If that doesnt work you have issues with MQ2MoveUtils . On Clerics that spam Complete Heals and interrupt them all Make sure you have UseDivArb set to 0 if you dont have that AA. // There's more to this than just the DivArb setting... but this might be one issue\\ On non-attacking pets/bots Check your MQ2Melee settings(the wiki for it is here ). You need a properly configured MQ2Melee for your pets/bots to attack and do other various melee-related tasks. On items being identified You aren't using the IRC plugin. By default /i is mapped to /identify. No slash commands work or error: \"DoCommand - Couldn't parse '/...' \" This usually happens when you update MQ2 and overwrite the macroquest.ini file. This file contains all the aliases (ie. the slash commands). To fix, delete the Version=X.XX line in RD_Common.ini, which will write all the aliases back to the macroquest.ini file when you restart Autobot. In general, you do not need to overwrite the Macroquest.ini file when updating MQ2. When your bot doesn't mem spells Your ini is set up wrong. Your XXXXGem#= entry needs to read \"gem#\", not just #. At least, 9 times out of 10 that's the problem. Check one of the sample ini files for an example. On My bots dont aquire targets when everything is set up properly Each toon needs a breastplate, it has to do with the way autobot checks deaths and runs the auto accept rez feature, it also disables assisting, for a good reason...","title":"Troubleshooting/FAQ"},{"location":"macros/gallery/autobot.mac/","tags":["macro"],"text":"AutoBot.mac \u00b6 Description \u00b6 AutoBot.mac by A_Druid_00 is a versatile macro for automating a lot of tasks for your character in group, raid and solo situations. Requirements \u00b6 AutoBot.mac does not run on a default MQ2 compilation, it has a few extra dependencies. Some of the below items are plugins and need to be compiled, just like MacroQuest2. Please read the appropriate documentation for each plugin. The Include files should be added to the same directory that AutoBot will be run from. Plugins: MQ2MoveUtils by Outlander This is so the macro knows about stick, /makecamp, and /moveto. Check out the wiki . MQ2Exchange by Wassup This is so that item swapping, casting, and swapping back will work MQ2Debuffs by pinkfloydx33 This is so the macro can keep track of your debuff counters. MQ2Melee by s0rcier So as to properly configure melee/ranged combat and various options thereof, check out the wiki . Includes Files: Wait4Rez.inc Handles pre-rez situations. spell_routines.inc Handles spell casting, from gems, items and AAs. QuickBeg2.inc Handles buff begging. Ninjadvloot.inc Handles looting. Getting Started \u00b6 Pointers for AutoBot stuffs. (We should make a multi-boxing wiki sometime, we could link it here...) In addition to the documentation for the various plugins used directly by AutoBot (see links in Requirements ) The following is useful info on other plugins you can use to enhance your AutoBot experience. MQ2Clip by Vaft, Cr4zyb4rd, et al. Manages the clip plane of backgrounded sessions. Your CPU will thank you. MQ2FPS by Lax. Helps manage framerates of EQ sessions, greatly helps multi-botting... Check out the wiki MQ2Eqbc by Omnictrl Is an alternative way to communicate with your bots. Configure your EQBC.ini with the following: [Last Connect] Server=192.168.1.101 (This must be edited to match the ip and port you have the server listening to) Port=2112 [Settings] AutoConnect=1 AllowControl=1 You will also need to change the channel setting in your AutoBot.ini from \"i say\" to \"bc\" to use it for bot to bot communication. Don't forget that if you are getting identify spam that you check loot.ini and QB2Settings.ini for any i say or i msg commands. QB2Settings.ini defaults to i msg and needs to be changed if using EQBC. Recommend MQ2NetBots , MQ2NetStat , and MQ2NetHeal to go along with this. More information available on Page 59 of the original AutoBot thread. Using AutoBot.mac \u00b6 1) The main macro file, 'yyy.mac' (called 'RaidDruid.mac' in the .zip file) can be named to 'AutoBot.mac' or 'AnythingYouWant.mac'. 2) To start the macro in EverQuest with MQ2 running; type '/macro yyy.mac Note: The first time you run the macro, it will generate an ini file called RD_xxx.ini 3) Configure your RD_xxx.ini, where 'xxx' is your character name. 3a) Peruse through RDCommon.ini and add in any mobs you might want to have certains spells ignore. I tend to put Guild Lobby and PoK NPCs as immune to mez, makes life simpler when walking around and I forget to pause my bots. 4)Restart Autobot after configuring RD_xxx.ini. 5) Enjoy the show. Bot Commands \u00b6 There are a few non-alias (no / required) commands available to Autobot. These commands will cause the bots to respond to a few general status/movement commands without the obvious /alias, for easy use in a group setting. Bots will only respond to commands sent by someone in the MasterList buffqueue This command has your bot respond in your ChatChannel with the # of buffs left in his \"buff queue\". Handy for deciding whether to continue pulling/crawling after a group wipe. Keep in mind that some longer cast spells such as Night's Dark Terror for enchanters have extremely long recast times, and so can sit in the queue for a while. follow This command will have your bots /stick to you. They will sit to med if needed and within your LeashLength. They will also break off to attack if /domelee is turned on and the MA is fighting something. They will also service buff requests and do debuffing if applicable and they are not moving. mana All bots with a mana pool bigger than 0 will report their current % mana in your /chatchannel. medtime All bots with a mana pool bigger than 0 will report their currently estimated time to full mana based on their current Mana Regen divided by their mana level. move up This command tells your bots to move up to your current location. If they are set to /makecamp, they will reset their camp X and Y loc to your current position. If they are following, they will resume following once they reach your position (This is handy for positioning your bots in front of doors/bridges before moving through/across them) stop This command tells the bots to stop following wherever they happen to be standing. Slash Commands \u00b6 AutoBot.mac comes with a great set of predefined Slash Commands for easy and fast in-game configuration. Uber macro pause/unpause hotkey (bound to for me, unlike normal EQ hotkeys 1-10, it works even while casting) Add the following lines to MQ2CustomBinds .txt: name=StartPauseDB down=/docommand ${If[!${Macro.Name.Equal[RaidDruid.mac]}, /mac RaidDruid.mac, /varset RDPause ${If[${RDPause}==1,0,1]}]} up= Then in game type _/bind StartPauseDB _ to bind that to your __ key. When pressed your __ key will start AutoBot if it's not already started. If it's already running it will toggle the pause on the macro. Here's a full list, divided into sub-sections for each category of Slash Commands there are (Each toggle alias works by itself, or will take an argument of ON/OFF, TRUE/FALSE, or 1/0): Melee \u00b6 /domelee Toggles automatic engaging of the MA's target in melee.(Must have the plugin MQ2Melee configured properly) General \u00b6 /addalert ${Target.CleanName} Adds targetted NPC to the list which will be ignored in the RDCommon.ini and will perform normally when near these npc's not treating them as hostile. ${Target.CleanName} can also be replaced with the name of the mob typed out or the ini file can be manually edited. /assistdelay Sets the amount of time the bot will wait between MA assists. (Ex. /assistdelay 5s) /assistma Toggles assisting of your designated MA1, MA2, and MA3. Turning this off essentially disables Melee, Nuking, DoTing, and Debuffing /autoninja Toggles auto looting of the nearest corpse after each XP gained message. Will only loot droppable items. Must have the plugin MQ2MoveUtils for this to work. /autosit Toggles auto sitting to med. Not much to say here. /chatchannel Sets the chat channel the bot reports to, (Ex. /chatchannel \"i say\"\ufffd) /docanni Toggles auto casting of your cannibalization spell when below your MedPct and above your CanniHPs. Also works for wizard harvest, mana robe, and necromancer Lich spells. /doyaulp Toggles auto casting of your yaulp spell when below your MedPct and there are NPCs within your NPCRadius. /engagehps Sets the % of the mobs HPs you want to start melee/debuffing/dotting/nuking (Ex. /engagehps 95) /ma1 Assigns a PC as Main Assist 1. (Ex. /ma1 BoDuke) /ma2 Assigns a PC as Main Assist 2. (Ex. /ma2 LukeDuke) /ma3 Assigns a PC as Main Assist 3. (Ex. /ma3 DaisyDuke) /leashlength Sets the distance your bot will allow itself to get from his follow target before resuming follow (Ex. /leashlength 25) /listspells Returns a list of all configured Spell Sets in your ini. /loadini \"IniFileName\" Loads a pre-configured ini file. /medpct Sets the % of Mana you want to sit or summon your horse at. (Ex. /medpct 50) /npcradius Sets the Radius (in feet) around you that you want to watch NPCs using Assist healing and Assisting the MA (Ex. /npcradius 200) /npczradius Sets the Radius (in feet) above/below you that you want to watch NPCs using Assist healing and Assisting the MA (Ex. /npczradius 200) /rdpause Toggles AutoBot's active functions on and off. /relaytells Toggles automatic reporting of tells sent to the bot in your configured /chatchannel /reportevents Toggles automatic reporting of your bot's status messages such as low food/drink, stunned/unstunned, encumbered, etc. /reportmana Toggles automatic reporting of your mana status if you get below the medpct, only reports once before going above the medpct. /reportmanapct Defines the point at which you want to start reporting your mana status to your chat channel. /reporttoggles Toggles automatic reporting of your toggle status of any /commands you send your bot in the ChatChannel. /reportwow Toggles automatic reporting of Wrath of the Wild on the MA /saveini \"IniFileName\" Creates an ini file named \"IniFileName\" /sitdelay Sets the amount of time you want to wait before sitting after casting any spell that might be considered aggro. (Ex. /sitdelay 5s) /stophps Sets the % of the mob's HPs you want to stop nuking and debuffing. (Ex. /stophps 10) /usemount Toggles automatic mount summoning at your /medpct, if this is off and /autosit is on, it will sit to med instead of summoning a mount. /npcradchk Sets the Radius (in feet) around you that defines how close mobs are allow before you stop buffing to avoid aggro (Ex. /npcradchk 100) Healing \u00b6 /aeheal Toggles on AE Healing. This creates an array of every PC within PCRadius, and cycles through every one of them, checking their HPs against your defined HealPct, and casts heals if appropriate. Super handy on mobs with AE Rampage or AE Damage effects. /assistheal Toggles on Assist Healing. This creates an array of every NPC within NPCRadius, and assists them to find the target of their aggression, and heals that target if necessary. Super handy for general clearing on raids before getting to named. Also causes target to constantly ping-pong wildly all over the place trying to find a target to heal /cancelpct Set this to the percentage of HPs you want AutoBot to cancel heals at. (Ex. /cancelpct 90) /checkgroup Sets the number of seconds you'd like to wait between HP evaluations /divarbhps Sets the % HPs you want to cast Divine Arbitration at if a groupmember gets below it (Ex. /divarbhps 25) /healchannel Sets the channel your bots use to report heals when they are cast. /healfd Toggles healing of FD classes (SK, Necro, Monk) only while they are FD (Ex. /healfd ON will only heal if they are FD) /healgroup Toggles healing of your group. With this on, it will heal groupmembers that are below HealPct /healmefirst Toggles healing of yourself over any group members. If you are mid-cast to heal someone else and your HPs fall below the HealPct, you will cancel it and heal yourself first. Self preservation at its finest. /healpct Sets the % of HPs you want to heal other PCs at. (ex. /healpct 70) /healpets Toggles healing of any pets in the group if they are below the PetHealPct /healramp Toggles automatic healing of your Rampage tank anytime a RAMPAGE message is detected. /interrupt Toggles interrupting debuffs/nukes/dots to heal group members. Some people like to just let their group members die instead of ducking a nuke to heal them. This is for those people! /pcradius Sets the Radius (in feet) around you that you want to watch PC HPs using AE healing (Ex. /pcradius 200) /pczradius Sets the Radius (in feet) above and below you that you want to watch PC HPs using AE healing (Ex. /pczradius 50) /pethealpct Sets the % of HPs you will heal pets at. (Ex. /pethealpct 40) /ramptank Sets the Rampage Tank that you check whenever a RAMPAGE message is seen with /healramp on. (Ex. /ramptank UncleJesse) /reportheals Toggles automatic reporting of heals in the ChatChannel /reportinterrupts Toggles automatic reporting of interrupts to heal in the ChatChannel /reportsotw Toggles automatic reporting of Spirit of the Wood in the ChatChannel /sotw Toggle auto casting of Spirit of the Wood /sotwpct Set this to the average group HP percentage you want it to auto cast Spirit of the Wood at. (Ex. /sotwpct 75) /tankhealpct Sets the % you start Chealing. Due to some predictive logic the Cheal may start earlier. Set this to the abslute floor you want to start CH at. /usech Toggles using your Cheal spell on MA1 on or off. It will monitor the tank's HPs and if he's taking enough damage to be dead in less than 20 seconds, it will duck out of whatever RD is currently doing and start a CH. If the tank's HPs stop falling and level off above the TankHealPct, it will cancel CH and wait until the tank's HPs fall again. /usedivarb Toggles using your divine arbitration or cleric epic 1.5 (if you have it) when a group member falls below the DivArbHPs. /waittocancel Toggle. When turned on, this will wait until your heals have less than .5 seconds left before making the decison to cancel the heal. Buffing \u00b6 AutoBot queues buff requests and casts them when appropriate. It will not cast buffs unless there are no mobs within 20 feet of the bot, it's not in combat, and it's not moving. It will hold onto those buff requests until you are no longer moving, not in combat, and there are no mobs within 20 feet. If you zone, all stored buffs are flushed, and you have to beg again. By default the bot only listens for /tells and IRC chat for buffing. If you want him to listen in other channels, you need to add #chat group to listen in group, or #chat chat to listen in EQ's chat channels; to the RaidDruid.mac file under the #chat tell line right near the top of the macro. More information on the #chat function can be found in the MacroQuest manual . Aliases: /buff \"Spell Name/Alias\" [Name | Group] Use this alias to send a buff command to your bot, will also accept buff aliases. You can use this to cast items and AAs as well as spells. If you specify Group instead of a name, it will buff your whole group with that spell, if it is a single target spell. In addition, you can cast it on any spawn including NPCs, Pets, Corpses, etc. (Ex. /buff \"Steeloak Skin\"\ufffd Bob, or /buff Oak Bob if oak is an alias for steeloak skin). If the /buff command utilizes a DoBuff alias, the buff request is queued and will not be performed during combat. If the Spell/AA/item name itself is used in the /buff command it is cast immediately. (Ex. /buff \"Exodus\" would fire right away, while /buff \"Evac\" would not). **WARNING: YOUR BOTS WILL NOT WATCH THE GROUP'S HPS OR ANYTHING ELSE WHILE EXECUTING A /BUFF COMMAND, USE IT WHEN YOU KNOW YOU DON'T NEED TO BE DOING ANYTHING ELSE IMPORTANT LIKE HEALING** /dobuffs Toggles automatic casting of buff requests made via /tell /dobufftells Toggles sending automatic replies to buff requests made via /tell /refreshbuffs Toggles automatic refreshing of buffs. Only buffs that are set to refresh in the ini will be refreshed. /reportdobuffs Toggles automatic reporting of buffs in the ChatChannel /reportselfbuffs Toggles automatic reporting of self buffs in the ChatChannel /selfbuff Toggles Self Buffing. Useful if you happen to be in an environment where having all your self buffs up puts you over the limit /wow Toggles automatic casting of Wrath of the Wild on your designated MA. I figure an extra 650 damage every 4 minutes cant hurt, since its mana free and all. Debuffing \u00b6 /debuff Toggles Auto debuffing. Pretty much all there is to say about that /debuffchannel Sets the channel your bots will use to report debuffs /dot Toggle Auto DoTing of mobs /mez Toggles Auto mezzing for those places where mez==bad /reportdebuffs Toggles reporting of debuffs in the ChatChannel /reportdots Toggles automatic report of DoTs in the ChatChannel /reportmez Toggles automatic report of Mezzes in the ChatChannel /usehott Toggles using the Health of Target's Target Leadership ability to determine a mob's aggro. Nuking \u00b6 /nuke Toggles Auto Nuking the MA's target. /nukedelay Sets the delay between chain nuking. If your tank sucks, or are in a kite group raise this delay to prevent agro. /nukeset Returns the current spell set # you are nuking from. Pet \u00b6 /petbuff Toggles automatic buffing of your pet /usepet Toggles automatic summoning and sending in of pet to melee. Curing \u00b6 This portion of the macro requires the MQ2Debuffs plugin by pinkfloydx33. See the requirements . /docures Toggles auto-curing on and off. /reportcures Toggles auto-cure reporting on and off. Bard \u00b6 This portion of the macro makes use of the MQ2Twist (See MQ2Twist wiki ) and MQ2BardSwap plugins. /addcombatsong |\"\" Adds the Alias or Song Name to the combat twist if a slot is available. /addrestsong |\"\" Adds the Alias or Song Name to the rest twist if a slot is available. /autorestoff When turned on it watches with each loop to see if any npc's are within the radius defined and will switch off rest songs if any are detected /autorestradius Sets the radius at which your bard will stop twisting when NPCs are present /combatsongs on|off Enables or Disables automatically twisting the combat twist temporarily. /delcombatsong |\"\" Removes the Alias or Song Name from the combat twist present. /delrestsong |\"\" Removes the Alias or Song Name from the rest twist if present. /listsongs combat|rest|all Lists the songs set to be twisted for the given twist type. /songalias \"Song Name\" Creates an alias for the given song name (must be in quotes if it has a space). INI entries \u00b6 .ini files will be automatically created and populated with default values if they do not exist.

Make sure to have a | for each buff, as it needs to count them to find out how many buff request strings to check for. Also be mindful of spaces, as the buff request will not be registered without the preceding and trailing spaces defined in the alias.

NukeMinMana1=30 (Set this to the lowest % mana you want to be before you stop nuking. Essentially this is where most of us set our mana reserve for other duties such as healing, debuffing, etc. For wizards though, this provides the ability to stop nuking with one spell, and start nuking with another spell below this % using the same % for MaxMana) GoMNuke1=0 (Set this to 0 if you don't want to cast this Nuke when Gift of Mana is up. Set it to 1, and it will use this nuke when GoM is up. Another addition mainly for wizards, it provides them the opportunity to get a 1 mana cost monster nuke off, instead of wasting it on a crappy lure or something. If set to 1, it will stop debuffing in favor of nuking while Gift of Mana is up. If you want to get your debuffing done over all else, then leave this at 0.

Songalias is basically to make it easier to change your combat/rest lineup on the fly with /addrestsong alias. Troubleshooting/FAQ \u00b6 On I set my ini to service XXXX skill/spell/aa but its not working got something spelled wrong or not filled out properly. check the examples again. On Dots/Debuffs that don't work, but (possibly) used to If in a group/raid with HoTT leadership skill set UseHoTT=1 in the ini file. If HoTT is not avialable you must set UseHoTT=0. Check to see the MaxMobs=5 is appropraite to the number of NPC's around you. Monsters that are green or sitting/laying down will never be debuffed/dotted. On Buff requests not being serviced Unless you indicate that you want the buff executed in combat the bot will not service the buff if there are NPC's nearby. You can have the macro ignore certain npcs that we know for certain arnt kos by adding their names in the RDCommon.ini .Alternatly the NPC check radius is adjustable in the ini. Also make sure that the buff name is spelled correctly just how it looks in the info window. Lastly make sure that the alias's are correct. in the example ini's it looks like this \"| convicton | viction | convic |\", however if you have it set up like that, the buff requester for all intents and purposes needs to put that word in a sentence. if you have the ini looking like this \"|convicton|viction|convic|\" with no spaces in between the \" | \" then the bot will reconize and ackowlege any tell that has any of the word alias's it sees. On Bot will assist but wont engage when set to The bigest thing you do to fix that is increase the NPCRadius=120, Also, consider verifiying, and tweaking the following as well. NPCZRadius=120, AssistMA=TRUE, , DoMelee=TRUE, AssistDelay=0s, MA1=Chuck_Norris, EngageHPs=101. aso remember that other options may be fighting for servicing. looting, selfbuffing, debuffing, buffing, etc.. so if melee is priority, turn everything but assisting off. also make sure that mq2melee is set up right. type /melee to bring up its console and see whats set and whats not. same thing goes. if your not a pet class turn off all that other stuff to prevent any chance of conflicts. On Cant load selo's into the ini Selos uses a \"````````````\" located to the left of the 1 key. On incorrectly mezed Targets (also known as: Oh why does my chanter mez my MA's target?) You need to properly set the target for the BOT by the Leader AA, or /varset MATarget ${Target.ID} as explained in \"On target acquisition\" On automatically mezzing NPCs when you don't want to Set /rdpause on the BOT you want to stop auto debuffing (rdpause stops all automatic activity), type \"/rdpause on\" \\(minus quotes\\) into your command channel to stop auto-activity on multiple BOT's at once, or add the NPC you wish to not mez to the immune/ignore list in RDCommon.ini. You will need to know the spell ID for the spell you wish not to cast and this can be found by ${Spell[My Mez Spell Name Here].ID} (Use /echo in front of ${Spell[My Mez Spell Name Here].ID} if your typing it in EQ) On Target acquisition AutoBot acquires the Main Assist's (MA) target in a number of ways. 1) By setting the MA in the bot's ini file and the assist delay, the macro will attempt to acquire the target of the MA after the set time. 2) By using the Delegate Main Assist leadership AA, the bot will acquire the MA's target that way. 3) By manually setting the MA's target using /varset MATarget ${Target.ID} in whatever channel your bots listen to commands in. On non-working clickies If you have a clicky with no recast timer that isn't working. (Such as Time's Antithesis, Veil of Lost Hopes, et al...) The odds are you have an old version of MQ2. As of the 20 th of Dec Zip, these issues have been fixed. if you don't know what version of the zip you have, try simply running /echo ${FindItem[item name].Timer} and seeing what value it returns. Anything other than zero is Bad(tm) and denotes an out-of-date zip file. Update, update, update! Also your last inventory slot must NOT be a bag. Clickies usable from inventory, even if usable in other slots, will be used from base inventory slot 8. On out-of-date alias lists If you are attempting to reload your alias to your macroquest.ini. You must remove the Version=X.XX from RD_common.ini. Doing this will make the Version mismatch appear and reload all the alias's On healing not working On heals that never cancel even though target's health goes above CancelPct Tankheal must be defined as a valid spell and different than FastHeal=, even if you are not using Tankheals (UseCH setting). On Green (non-XP) corpses that are not auto looted These are not looted automatically. To trigger looting, at any time, send your bot \"You gain party experience!\" in whatever channel it is set to monitor. On late/not reliable buffs Bots will not buff in combat. Also it will not sit to memorize buffs if a NPC is within a certain range, although using a horse remedies this. On non-refreshing buffs on bots themselves Buffs from the [DoBuffStuff] or buff command are not rebuffed on the same bot that cast them, because you dont get a buff wear off message when they wear off yourself. If you want certain buffs kept up on your bot, you should use [SelfBuffStuff] section. On bots that keep targeting some npc, even though it hasn't been told it to assist and kill it Your MA could have a corpse close, and that is being assisted to get a target. Or you could be using an old version of autobot. On non-following bots Target someone and type /stick. If that doesnt work you have issues with MQ2MoveUtils . On Clerics that spam Complete Heals and interrupt them all Make sure you have UseDivArb set to 0 if you dont have that AA. // There's more to this than just the DivArb setting... but this might be one issue\\ On non-attacking pets/bots Check your MQ2Melee settings(the wiki for it is here ). You need a properly configured MQ2Melee for your pets/bots to attack and do other various melee-related tasks. On items being identified You aren't using the IRC plugin. By default /i is mapped to /identify. No slash commands work or error: \"DoCommand - Couldn't parse '/...' \" This usually happens when you update MQ2 and overwrite the macroquest.ini file. This file contains all the aliases (ie. the slash commands). To fix, delete the Version=X.XX line in RD_Common.ini, which will write all the aliases back to the macroquest.ini file when you restart Autobot. In general, you do not need to overwrite the Macroquest.ini file when updating MQ2. When your bot doesn't mem spells Your ini is set up wrong. Your XXXXGem#= entry needs to read \"gem#\", not just #. At least, 9 times out of 10 that's the problem. Check one of the sample ini files for an example. On My bots dont aquire targets when everything is set up properly Each toon needs a breastplate, it has to do with the way autobot checks deaths and runs the auto accept rez feature, it also disables assisting, for a good reason...","title":"AutoBot.mac"},{"location":"macros/gallery/autobot.mac/#autobotmac","text":"","title":"AutoBot.mac"},{"location":"macros/gallery/autobot.mac/#description","text":"AutoBot.mac by A_Druid_00 is a versatile macro for automating a lot of tasks for your character in group, raid and solo situations.","title":"Description"},{"location":"macros/gallery/autobot.mac/#requirements","text":"AutoBot.mac does not run on a default MQ2 compilation, it has a few extra dependencies.

On Buff requests not being serviced Unless you indicate that you want the buff executed in combat the bot will not service the buff if there are NPC's nearby. You can have the macro ignore certain npcs that we know for certain arnt kos by adding their names in the RDCommon.ini .Alternatly the NPC check radius is adjustable in the ini. Also make sure that the buff name is spelled correctly just how it looks in the info window. Lastly make sure that the alias's are correct. in the example ini's it looks like this \"| convicton | viction | convic |\", however if you have it set up like that, the buff requester for all intents and purposes needs to put that word in a sentence. if you have the ini looking like this \"|convicton|viction|convic|\" with no spaces in between the \" | \" then the bot will reconize and ackowlege any tell that has any of the word alias's it sees. On Bot will assist but wont engage when set to The bigest thing you do to fix that is increase the NPCRadius=120, Also, consider verifiying, and tweaking the following as well. NPCZRadius=120, AssistMA=TRUE, , DoMelee=TRUE, AssistDelay=0s, MA1=Chuck_Norris, EngageHPs=101. aso remember that other options may be fighting for servicing. looting, selfbuffing, debuffing, buffing, etc.. so if melee is priority, turn everything but assisting off. also make sure that mq2melee is set up right. type /melee to bring up its console and see whats set and whats not. same thing goes. if your not a pet class turn off all that other stuff to prevent any chance of conflicts. On Cant load selo's into the ini Selos uses a \"````````````\" located to the left of the 1 key. On incorrectly mezed Targets (also known as: Oh why does my chanter mez my MA's target?) You need to properly set the target for the BOT by the Leader AA, or /varset MATarget ${Target.ID} as explained in \"On target acquisition\" On automatically mezzing NPCs when you don't want to Set /rdpause on the BOT you want to stop auto debuffing (rdpause stops all automatic activity), type \"/rdpause on\" \\(minus quotes\\) into your command channel to stop auto-activity on multiple BOT's at once, or add the NPC you wish to not mez to the immune/ignore list in RDCommon.ini. You will need to know the spell ID for the spell you wish not to cast and this can be found by ${Spell[My Mez Spell Name Here].ID} (Use /echo in front of ${Spell[My Mez Spell Name Here].ID} if your typing it in EQ) On Target acquisition AutoBot acquires the Main Assist's (MA) target in a number of ways. 1) By setting the MA in the bot's ini file and the assist delay, the macro will attempt to acquire the target of the MA after the set time. 2) By using the Delegate Main Assist leadership AA, the bot will acquire the MA's target that way. 3) By manually setting the MA's target using /varset MATarget ${Target.ID} in whatever channel your bots listen to commands in. On non-working clickies If you have a clicky with no recast timer that isn't working. (Such as Time's Antithesis, Veil of Lost Hopes, et al...) The odds are you have an old version of MQ2. As of the 20 th of Dec Zip, these issues have been fixed. if you don't know what version of the zip you have, try simply running /echo ${FindItem[item name].Timer} and seeing what value it returns. Anything other than zero is Bad(tm) and denotes an out-of-date zip file. Update, update, update! Also your last inventory slot must NOT be a bag. Clickies usable from inventory, even if usable in other slots, will be used from base inventory slot 8. On out-of-date alias lists If you are attempting to reload your alias to your macroquest.ini. You must remove the Version=X.XX from RD_common.ini. Doing this will make the Version mismatch appear and reload all the alias's On healing not working On heals that never cancel even though target's health goes above CancelPct Tankheal must be defined as a valid spell and different than FastHeal=, even if you are not using Tankheals (UseCH setting). On Green (non-XP) corpses that are not auto looted These are not looted automatically. To trigger looting, at any time, send your bot \"You gain party experience!\" in whatever channel it is set to monitor. On late/not reliable buffs Bots will not buff in combat. Also it will not sit to memorize buffs if a NPC is within a certain range, although using a horse remedies this. On non-refreshing buffs on bots themselves Buffs from the [DoBuffStuff] or buff command are not rebuffed on the same bot that cast them, because you dont get a buff wear off message when they wear off yourself. If you want certain buffs kept up on your bot, you should use [SelfBuffStuff] section. On bots that keep targeting some npc, even though it hasn't been told it to assist and kill it Your MA could have a corpse close, and that is being assisted to get a target. Or you could be using an old version of autobot. On non-following bots Target someone and type /stick. If that doesnt work you have issues with MQ2MoveUtils . On Clerics that spam Complete Heals and interrupt them all Make sure you have UseDivArb set to 0 if you dont have that AA. // There's more to this than just the DivArb setting... but this might be one issue\\ On non-attacking pets/bots Check your MQ2Melee settings(the wiki for it is here ). You need a properly configured MQ2Melee for your pets/bots to attack and do other various melee-related tasks. On items being identified You aren't using the IRC plugin. By default /i is mapped to /identify. No slash commands work or error: \"DoCommand - Couldn't parse '/...' \" This usually happens when you update MQ2 and overwrite the macroquest.ini file. This file contains all the aliases (ie. the slash commands). To fix, delete the Version=X.XX line in RD_Common.ini, which will write all the aliases back to the macroquest.ini file when you restart Autobot. In general, you do not need to overwrite the Macroquest.ini file when updating MQ2. When your bot doesn't mem spells Your ini is set up wrong. Your XXXXGem#= entry needs to read \"gem#\", not just #. At least, 9 times out of 10 that's the problem. Check one of the sample ini files for an example. On My bots dont aquire targets when everything is set up properly Each toon needs a breastplate, it has to do with the way autobot checks deaths and runs the auto accept rez feature, it also disables assisting, for a good reason...","title":"Troubleshooting/FAQ"},{"location":"macros/gallery/barter/","tags":["macro"],"text":"Barter \u00b6 #turbo Sub Main() /declare itemname string local /declare itemqty int local /declare itemprice int local /declare result int local /if (!${Window[BarterMerchantWnd].Open}) {``` :RightClickBuyer /click right target `/delay 10s ${Window[BarterMerchantWnd].Open} /if (!${Window[BarterMerchantWnd].Open}) { /echo You need to move closer to your target /delay 1s /goto :RightClickBuyer } } /delay 3s /for result 1 to 100 /if (${Bool[${Window[BarterMerchantWnd].Child[BTRMERCH_BuyLineList].List[${result},2]}]}) { /varset itemname ${Window[BarterMerchantWnd].Child[BTRMERCH_BuyLineList].List[${result},2]} /varset itemqty ${Window[BarterMerchantWnd].Child[BTRMERCH_BuyLineList].List[${result},3]} /varset itemprice ${Window[BarterMerchantWnd].Child[BTRMERCH_BuyLineList].List[${result},4]} /echo ${result} ${itemname} ${itemqty} ${itemprice} } /next result /return","title":"Barter"},{"location":"macros/gallery/barter/#barter","text":"#turbo Sub Main() /declare itemname string local /declare itemqty int local /declare itemprice int local /declare result int local /if (!${Window[BarterMerchantWnd].Open}) {``` :RightClickBuyer /click right target `/delay 10s ${Window[BarterMerchantWnd].Open} /if (!${Window[BarterMerchantWnd].Open}) { /echo You need to move closer to your target /delay 1s /goto :RightClickBuyer } } /delay 3s /for result 1 to 100 /if (${Bool[${Window[BarterMerchantWnd].Child[BTRMERCH_BuyLineList].List[${result},2]}]}) { /varset itemname ${Window[BarterMerchantWnd].Child[BTRMERCH_BuyLineList].List[${result},2]} /varset itemqty ${Window[BarterMerchantWnd].Child[BTRMERCH_BuyLineList].List[${result},3]} /varset itemprice ${Window[BarterMerchantWnd].Child[BTRMERCH_BuyLineList].List[${result},4]} /echo ${result} ${itemname} ${itemqty} ${itemprice} } /next result /return","title":"Barter"},{"location":"macros/gallery/cleric.mac-nytemyst/","tags":["macro"],"text":"Cleric.mac - nytemyst \u00b6 Forum Link \u00b6 Cleric.mac - Nytemyst Description \u00b6 This macro is mainly for high level cleric, but possible for low levels to use.

They are NOT required but must be set in the INI for the bot to function correctly if not provided. The macro will create an INI file for you to customize called, dR_ToonsName.ini, in your macro directory. (Ex. dR_Bobshaman.ini) After the INI file is created, it will end the macro and you MUST edit the new INI file. Then you can restart the macro(You will not need to edit it after it has been set once unless you need to change a setting. This macro DOES NOT REQUIRE ANY PLUGIN but it will use MQ2EQBC if you want it to. However, there is no support for it on this macro at this time. Commands and Aliases \u00b6 None at this time. Dynamic Mana \u00b6 More to be posted later. Spell Gem Optimization \u00b6 Add to your macro before main loop: /declare numGem int outer /declare OWgem int outer /call GemOpt Subs for use within macro \u00b6 /call GemMem ${SpellGem} ${SpellName} ${SpellGemState} ${MOWState} ex. /call GemMem ${NukeGem} ${Nuke} ${NukeStatus} TRUE /call GemMem 4 \"Ice Spear of Solist\" TRUE FALSE /call GemMem 0 \"Complete Healing\" FALSE ${CHAlwaysOW} /call GemMem 9 \"Ancient: Hallowed Light\" ${KeepAH} ${AHOverWrite} SpellNameHere must be a string, SpellGemHere must be a integer, SpellGemState must be TRUE/FALSE FALSE means that the spell will stay until a spell is memmed over top of it within the macro by the user or manually deleted. TRUE flags the gem as switchable. Spells will be memmed to the least used switchable slot SpellGemHere when it equals 0, means that the sub will memorize into the first switchable gem it finds that is available. If no gems are available, it finds the switchable gem that has not been cast in the longest time Each timer for each switchable gem is set to a default of five minutes. Lowest timer will be overwritten, or first in list if multiple timers are at 0 * MOWState is just a TRUE/FALSE constant that tells the sub to overwrite it if no gems can be switched and you don't want to use the OWgem IF you want the timer function to work correctly, you must add this line directly after casts in your macro /if (${Macro.Return.Equal[CAST_SUCCESS]}) /call GemTimer ${Me.Gem[<${SpellThatWasCast}>]} /call GemEdit ${SpellName - OR - SpellGem} ex. /if (${SpGem[1,2]}) /call GemEdit 1 /call GemEdit \"Complete Healing\" /call GemEdit ${QuickHeal} /if (${Nuke.Equal[${SpGem[${NukeGem},1]}]}) /call GemEdit ${NukeGem} This sub is used to switch states of memorized spells or spell gems. IF the spell name isnt found, no change will occur. This state will be changed next time a gem will be memorized, therefore no need to mindlessly call GemFind dRShmbot Ini Settings \u00b6 Sample Ini [DRShmBot] UseMq2EQBC=FALSE(TRUE if you want macro to use MQ2EQ Box Chat Plugin) -- You must also have the EQBCS server running.

It dememorizes the spell in whatever slot chosen(1-9) GemEdit -- This sub routine takes the spell name or gem-number and switches it from switchable/not-switchable to not-switchable/switchable GemTimer -- A subroutine to be called after spell casts if you want the include to monitor the usage of the spell. Spells often will not be replaced by spells that aren't cast as often. GemFind -- A subroutine to scan the spell information, stored user-responses and available/used gems to find a suitable gem for memorization. Putting all these functions together, this include micromanages the use of spell gems within a routine.

How To \u00b6 To use ModBot Extract and place all included files from zip (all .mac and .inc files) into your MQ2 macro directory. From inside EQ, type /macro modbot (e.g. /macro modbot OR /macro modbot raidmode). This will build, if it doesn't exist, your MB_.ini file. Optional entries will make a MB__.ini. Being shrouded on startup without using an option will use your race and class for the creation of an MB__.ini file. From inside EQ, end the macro by typing /endmac Tab out of EQ, locate your new MB_.ini file in your macro directory, and open it. You can use the editor of your choice, but Notepad will work just fine. For every component of the macro you want to use, increase the respective \"count\", if you want two heals, set AHCount=2, if you want 2 debuffs, set ADCount=2, etc. After you have set your counts, save and close the INI file. Tab back over into EQ and restart the macro (/macro modbot). This will now populate your INI file based on the count entries that you made in the previous step End the macro again by typing /endmac Open the INI file once more and \"tweak\" the newly created entries to fit your needs. When you are done, save and close the INI file. Tab back over to EQ and restart the macro. Your bot should now be just that, a BOT and will listen to your every command (assuming you are the master). For examples of complete class ModBot INI files, please go to the example INI page . Please Note!! One thing to keep in mind throughout the configuration of the ModBot INI file: keep your most critical and most used spells, activities, etc., first in their respective INI sections. You don't want your mez spell as Debuff number 20, you don't want slow as debuff 10, you don't want a CBT based buff as buff 23, and you don't want CH as heal 1 (you want your most desperate heal as heal 1), etc. Configure your heals, buffs, debuffs, etc. in a highest priority first order. Reference to Understanding the ModBot WiKi \u00b6 - Replace this with the respective descriptor Example 1 -_is luclin_bobby Example 2 -is bobby (text) - These are \"comments\" and should be removed when saving the respective file Example 1 - Send=1 (If set to 1 it will send netbots information over the network) This text: *``\\(If`````set to 1 it will send netbots information over the network)``\\*`should NOT appear in the INI file` ````` [text\\] - This is to show different options or series of options Example 1 - /bc cast[, %t, grp,, etc]`` Plugin Requirements & Examples \u00b6 I suggest you have a good understanding of how to configure each of these plugins.

probably most common but check out the EQBC Forum thread for more methods / features. You can also configure an alias so you can run modbot on the character you control and execute ModBot commands. To create the alias you must run this from the EQ prompt: /alias /mb /echo mb- Or change the LoadAlias variable in MBCommon.inc [Settings] section from 0 to 1 if you've lost the alias in your Macroquest.ini With this alias you can tell your bot locally what to do: /mb makecamp /mb buffup /mb letsroll /mb Command Reference \u00b6 Section Updated: June 7, 2009 abort (Interrupts any cast in progress, Sets - DoHeals, DoDebuffs & DoMelee FALSE and follows the sender closely, usefull when you want to RUN away) addbuff \"\\|\\\" ABSpellAlias ABTarType (Adds a new buff entry to the character's INI file.) You must restart the ModBot macro after executing the addbuff command in order to complete the adding of the buff entry. The Spellname, etc. section can be entered directly (e.g. */mb addbuff \"Bone Mask of the Ancient Iksar|item\" iksar self_) or, if adding a clicky, by holding the item on your cursor (e.g._ /mb addbuff \"${Cursor.Name}|item\" iksar self*). Please note that the quotes around the spellname|gem section are required. ABTarType will accept multiple targets if quotes are used (e.g. */mb addbuff \"Levitiation|gem1\" levi \"war mnk rog\"*). addbuff execution will add ABGem, ABSpell, ABSpellAlias and ABTarType entries to the characters INI file. The remaining buff lines (ABSpellFociX, ABDurModX, etc.) will be added once you restart the ModBot macro (the array size change (ABCount) will also not increment until after re-start). For example, using these Bonemask example command, the following entires will be added to the INI file (where \"X\" is equal to whatever the next numbered entry is in your advbuff section): ABGemX=item ABSpellX=Bone Mask of the Ancient Iksar ABSpellAliasX=iksar ABTarTypeX=self attack (Sets DoMelee TRUE and forces bot to attack the TankName's target) attack (Sets DoMelee TRUE and forces bot to attack the target) * Note: OffTank must be TRUE to use this option (I may remove this requirement though TBD) * Example 1 - /bc attack badguy * Example 2 = /bc attack badguy 100 20 buffup (This will set DoBuffs & DoEvents TRUE & DoHeals FALSE) campout (Performs a /camp desktop and ends the macro) cast <on/off> (This will disable or enable the spell associated with this alias) cast [<spawnname/id> \\<%t> ] [<spawnname/id> \\<%t> ] (infinte) If the spell is detrimental, CAST targets the requester's target. If the spell is beneficial, it targets the sender or, if grp is present, it casts buff on group members. If %t is present, it targets the requester's target. The cast command will ignore INI settings for things like minmana, maxmana, recasts, buff debuff counters, etc. This command is mainly used for manual, \"one off\" type casts. Example 1 - /bc cast buffhp grp haste bob haste jane dmgshld bob Example 2 - /bc cast dmgshld bob nuke tash Example 3 - /bc cast slow \"nasty add\" doafk [on, true, off, false, ] dobuffbot [on, true, off, false, ] (Places the bot in \"BuffBot Mode\". Currently once set to on or true, it will NOT turn off and you MUST restart the macro to \"quit\" this mode. It will cast any spell alias on the requesting target. The requester must be a \"master\". Example: /t buffhp dobuffs [on, true, off, false, ] docombines (Toggle that turns docombines on/off (default off). Docombines will check for an open tradeskill window with an enabled combine button (you have to select recipe), and will click the button. Upon a successful combine, Modbot's built in cursor handling takes over. Useful for tank to summon more arrows during fight. An associated event will fire and toggle docombines to FALSE when you run out of recipe components.) docures [on, true, off, false, ] dodebuffs [on, true, off, false, ] doevents [on, true, off, false, ] doforage [on, true, off, false, ] dofw [on, true, off, false, ] doheals [on, true, off, false, ] dolist (Used to /bc out the existing \"Do\" status) doloot [on, true, off, false, ] domelee [on, true, off, false, ] domount [on, true, off, false, ] (To cast a mount or not, used in conjunction with MountCast INI entry) dopet [on, true, off, false, ] (To cast a pet or not, used in conjunction with PetCast INI entry) dopull [on, true, off, false, ] (not fully production yet) dopull <on/off/path> (Self explanatory. See the instructions on forums.) doquest [on,true,off,false] (Default is TRUE. If set to FALSE, your looter will ignore items marked \"quest\" and still loot other items.) Can be used to add quest items to your loot.ini file. For example, while holding an item on cursor, */mb doquest 4 Hair of the Dog* will set the item you're holding to \"=Quest|4|Hair of the Dog|\" in loot.ini. Can also be used in conjunction with the QuestOnly variable (found in the setting section of the loot.ini file). If both doquest and QuestOnly are set to TRUE, your toon will only loot quest items. Also note that if QuestOnly is set to TRUE and doquest is set to FALSE, your toon will only loot cash off of mobs. Please see the modloot section found here for more information on the loot.ini file. dosit [on, true, off, false, ] dosongs [on, true, off, false, ] (used for bards only) dotells [on, true, off, false, ] (Toggles a beep when tells are recieved from non-netbots toons. Useful for tells in background sessions) **exclude ** (Adds to alert list, to save list you must use the \"save\" option, otherwise it will not be written to the INI file) The exclude list is dynamic and will only exclude mobs that are present in the zone AND that are on the list. If you want to force an exclude you must edit the INI file and place a \"#\" in front of the mobs name (e.g. ExcludeList=a dusty barrel|a dark coffin|#a bitten victim|a hollow tree|, this will always force \"a bitten victim\" to be on the exclude list) Use the following commands from a character to add mobs to the exclude list (Kroak suggested just tossing this in a two-line hotkey): /bcaa //mb exclude ${Target.CleanName} Will write the exclusion to a string that is checked through the debuff loop /bcaa //mb exclude save Will write the exclusion in the mbcommon.ini and that exclusion includes the zone id, so mobs of the same name in a different zone are NOT excluded. You shouldn't have to re-run the macro after an exclude but if you do this in the midst of comabat or something, while mobs are near, it may not \"take\" as quickly. For mob names with spaces in them, simply enter the name without any quotations. For example: ''/bcaa //mb exclude a small bat See the Include command (found below) to temporarily remove a mob from the alert list follow (Follows the sender or ) follow close (Follows the sender within 3 steps, very close) give (Calls the sub GiveCheck to hand an item to a toon or NPC.) ItemCount is optional and will default to 1. The give command can be used in conjunction with categories that have been defined in the loot.ini. For instance, if you have items marked 'SpellScroll' in your loot.ini, and the Category variable has \"SpellScroll\" included, you can issue the give command as follows: /mb give Bob SpellScroll TRUE . The result will be that all items on your toon that are marked with that category (SpellScroll) in your loot.ini will be handed to Bob.) * goto (Bot will move to the loc given) * handin (Target an NPC or PC, get one item on your cursor, and all of that item will be handed to them and trade or give button pressed.) holdup (This will set DoBuffs,DoDebuffs,DoEvents,DoMelee all to FALSE) include (Removes from alert list, this will not save to the INI file, see exclude save) letsroll (This will set DoBuffs,DoHeals,DoMelee,DoEvents,DoDebuffs TRUE) makecamp (This will Makecamp at existing location. Use /makecamp off or /mb stop to toggle makecamp functionality off) mana (Used to /bc out the existing Mana % of the bot) mbpause or mbp [on, true, off, false, ] (Used to pause or unpause the macro) mbwayplay (Used to playback previously recorded paths / waypoints, through zones, doors, chaining paths, etc.) mbwayrec (Used to record a path / waypoint.) Once started, ducking for each location will add a waypoint to the path. Sitting stops path recording and returns to modbot functions. To add doors, chains, pull locations, etc. you'll need to edit the MBWayPlay.INI file Further information about mbwayplay and mbwayrec (along with examples) can be found here in the wiki. * offtank <on/off> (Toggles offtanking for dealing with adds.) * script (This will allow you to run custom commands while the macro is running, or combine series of commands, see script examples in manual / rev notes) sell (You must be within range of a merchant in order to function, it will sell loot marked as \"=SELL\" in the loot.ini file) sell (With NPC targeted will attempt to sell all items marked \"sell\" in your lootIni file to target. Otherwise optional target name can be supplied.) setinivar (This will find and change any setting in your .ini) Note that this command will have trouble with script settings if you have more than one (it will set the first C1= or whatever that it comes to. Variables changed in the .ini are /varset with the macro running Spells, gems, etc. will not be set unless you use the array correctly for . In other words, ADGem[1] is not the same as ADGem1: Use ADGem[1] and this will set the ADGem1 .ini setting and varset the change to memory. Use ADGem1 and it will only change the .ini. This still has a problem finding variables in very long sections. If /echo \\({Ini\\[\\) , ]} is over the MAX_STRING value - (You go LD typing that if it is). - Stuff like ABGem[20] is almost never found. (Still working on that.) For example, Ligament Slice for a rogue was set up from in-game with these commands typed in to the MQ window (and the rogue was able to put it immediately to use): /mb setinivar ADCount 4 (restart macro - had 0 count before) /mb setinivar ADGem[1] alt /mb setinivar ADSpell[1] Ligament Slice /mb setinivar ADTarBegHP[1] 40 /mb setinivar ADTarCnt[1] 1 /mb setinivar ADTarType[1] 1 /mb setinivar ADAnnounce[1] /bc /mb setinivar ADSpellAlias[1] snare sing (Will sing this song and add the respective gem number to the Twist.List, it attempts to use detrimental as the qualifier to add it to combat songs, or rest songs) stop (Will stop following and/or stop in place) sung (Will remove this song from the respective Twist.List, it attempts to use detrimental as the qualifier to remove it from combat songs, or rest songs) ModBot in game usage and commands \u00b6 Example commands: /bc Bob follow me [This tells bob and only bob to follow me] /bc cast dd [this tells every bot to cast the spell alias dd] /bc shamandude cast buffsta grp buffhp focus grp buffhp %T [buffsta on the group, buffhp on the requester, focus on the group, buffhp on requesters target] /bc necroguy makecamp [this tells \"necroguy\" to makecamp] /bc campout [tells all bots to camp to desktop] /bc exclude ${Target.CleanName} [tells all bots to add your target to the exclude / ignore list, toons will not attack any spawn with that name.] /bc clericname dobuffs on [tells the cleric to set DoBuffs to true and will then begin buffing group] /bc pallyguy cast bmb %t buffhp grp [bmb on requesters target, buffhp on the group] Typical commands sequence for an EXP group: /bc letsroll /bc makecamp You then begin to pull mobs and they will react accordingly. Mobile Camp Example: /bc follow /bc buffup [once ready zone into the instance] /bc stop /bc letsroll [clear first room lets say] /bc follow [move to next room] /bc makecamp [etc, repeat] Example movement options with or without invis /bc mbp on /bc follow Make a EQBC Channel and do things like (using this technique you don't even have to be a master) /bct mycoolchannelname //mb letsroll /bct mycoolchannelname //mb campout ModBot INI Settings \u00b6 PreFace Notes \u00b6 Spell Alias's must be unique across all alias's Obsolete? 06272011 -Changed - ? \"cast\" command usage now allows for multiple aliases. If you have several spells with the same alias, using /bc castwill now cast all spells marked. Example, for shaman you can have Fo7, Talisman of Boar, Talisman of Wrulan, Talisman of Tribunal, ect.. all marked with \"fullgroup\". \"/mb cast fullgroup\" will cast each spell in the order they are found in the .ini file. `Buffing - Group buffs can now be seperated to different classes, and will allow keeping the spell on netbots members in seperate groups from the caster with the inclusion of keyword `\"raid\". Example -````` Code: ``````[AB2] ABGem=8 ABSpell=Focus of the Seventh ABSpellFoci= ABDurMod=50 ABSpellAlias=fo7|grpfocus|fullgroup ABAnnounce= ABSpellMinMana=20 ABTarCnt=2 ABTarType=war shd pal rng mnk rog brd bst ber shm dru wiz mag enc nec raid ABRecast=FALSE ABSpellIcon= ABPreCondition=TRUE Note from the above example that clr is not included in the TarType.. My clerics have the spell blocked. Attempting to cast on them will cause a chain loop of``````casting until the cleric gets self buff on that doesn't \"stack\" with focus. - so watch spell stacking and make sure to set your toons accordingly.``````````` Old format of \"self\" will also work with no change if you don't want to buff other groups with the spell. Commands - Tell commands will now check buff aliases, and don't need \"cast\" to ask for buffs.. \"/tellfullgroup\" from a non-master toon will make the shaman cast every spell with that alias on the sender of the tell. Masters still require use of \"cast\". - This does allow guildies or whoever else knows your aliases to get buffs easily. /say is not affected and is still not enabled for modbot. `` Added \"docommand\" - Master toons that aren't in netbots can now directly command toons. \"/telldocommand /sit\" will make the receiving toon sit, or execute any command after ````` the \"docommand\" keyword. - Word of caution - You can cause macro errors with this if you aren't careful. The command sent is executed directly with /docommand in the macro. A tell received of \"/telldocommand /sit\" will locally execute \"/docommand /sit\" Watch extra characters and or brackets.. - Because of the nature of this one, the commanding toon MUST be listed in MasterList.` You should be familiar or at least capable of making MQ2Bandolier sets as they are used by MQ2Cast for \"foci\" items Please treat the Buff, Debuff, Event, Heal INI sections as a first in first out (FIFO). Highest priority to lowest priority, you don't want mez or slow as AD12 but as AD1. You don't want AH1 as Complete Heal, you want AH1 to be DA/DB (those are examples, use common sense) If you want to add some visual zip to your announcements (things are easy to miss in /bc..), you can use color coding and the like in any of your Announce settings. For example, *Announce=/bc [+r+]Group Mez +x+ \\<\\<[+y+] %t [+x+]>> with +g+ %s [+x+]* will produce a line in the MQ chat window that is MUCH easier to see than the regular fonts. Rk. XX Usage - Heals, buffs, debuffs, and cures have code added to check your book and find the correct version of the spell you're using on startup of modbot. Rk. II and Rk. III are not needed, but only for these sections. If you upgrade a normal spell in these sections to Rk. II or III, restarting the macro will make the new spell work. Please note that this does not apply to discs, potionbelt, abilities, or PetCast at this time (meaning you must include the Rk. XX in the spell name for these types). Setting spell duration modifications (AHDurMod, ADDurMod, ABDurMod, AEDurMod) - Use the following formula to determine what number to set your DurMod at: \\({Spell[X\\].Duration} \\* (\\) +${Spell[X].Duration}) == timer duration. So if you want a 25% extension on the timer, set durmod to 25 to make ${Spell[X].Duration} * 1.25 = timer. Modbot shouldn't re-cast if timer is still running.

Uses same script format as ACBefore. AdvHeal Section [AdvHeal] \u00b6 Please note that for FD class toons and ${Group.Puller} - If they are out of ACLeash range and not FD, they will not be healed (to prevent aggro on group), but only if healer is not in 'combat' combatstate. If not in combat they will be healed. For group heal spells, you must set the TarCnt to something greater than 1 in order for the spell to evaluate correctly (and be used as a \"group\" heal when more than one member of the group requires healing). For instance, if you have TarCnt=3, then at least 3 members of your group will need to be below the HP level that you set in the Class line. A possible issue may arise when the cleric is in a loop state where a single heal is being fired \\(AHHealMode\\) - it may take a bit for it to realize the single heal should be stopped and the group heal cast instead. Depending on how you have it configured, the use of AHHealMode can force it to not even check the your group heal spell as it's being told to only check one \\(the single heal\\) . If this is the case (and not the desired result), perhaps use the group heal as the spell to check in AHHealMode. AHCount=# Number of heals you plan to have. AHNewFormat=# Set to '1' for ModBot v4 INI format Set to '0' for ModBot v3.49 INI format AHCheckTime=# How often to check for heals in seconds. AHHealOOBC=TRUE|FALSE Do I heal characters outside of Netbots and EQBC (e.g. folks not running MQ2 or mercenaries.) AHHealOOBC Thinking of an english name for that setting, all that comes up is \"Heal Outside Of BC\". So, in other words, if the setting is FALSE, it won't heal anyone that's not on YOUR EQBC server with the netbots plugin set up correctly, even if they're in your group. That is why I recommend you connect all toons and run modbot on all of them at least once, even if you don't plan to run it as a regular thing for the other toons.. It assures the plugins are set correctly. If AHHealOOBC=TRUE, then modbot will heal group members and pets even if there's no netbots connection. Out of group healing can only be done by the macro if there's a netbots connection, or if the other toon is a master and uses the cast command via /tell. I do recommend AHHealOOBC=TRUE setting, but I still left the default FALSE so people could check their connections before setting TRUE.

Buffs are a pita because if the debuff sub is called \\(it is called first\\) it won't cast the debuffs if there's any reason not to, then the macro runs through the whole buff loop before getting back to debuffs again.. Setting the TarBegHP at least over the level of all other functions at least attempts to keep the slow first. Also.. I find the macro works best if you always set your ACManaPct very low. Usually keep mine around 5 or so for every toon. I should change the default on that, but clearing targets and such is something your toon will do quite often if his mana is under that value.\" - Ptarp on the forums on Wed Mar 09, 2011 7:54 pm. (edited into Wiki by Arblis) AdvBuff Section [AdvBuff] \u00b6 If you want to cast single target buffs after group buffs, place all of your group buffs first. ABCount=# Number of buffs you plan to have. ABNewFormat=x Set 'x' to 1 for ModBot v4 style Set 'x' to 0 for MobBot v3.49 style ABMobMax=# Max number of targets to track for buffs (do not include pets) ABCheckTime=# How often to check for buffs in seconds [ABx] Where 'x' is the number of buff spell Gem=source Designate what the source of the spell is. Valid entries: gem number, alt, ability, item, script, potionbelt Note that 'potionbelt' does not require a slot number. Examples: Gem=3 Cast this spell from gem 3 Gem=alt This spell is an alternative advancement ability Spell=source name Valid entries: spell name, item name, alternate ability name, ability name, script name Examples: Spell=Minor Shielding This would be generally be paired with an Gem entry indicating which spell gem to cast Minor Shielding from. Spell=Uber Wand Thingy of Uberness This would be generally be paired with an Gem entry indicating that the source of this spell is an item. * SpellFoci=setname * Bandolier set name to swap in before casting this spell. * Please see MQ2Bandolier and MQ2Cast to understand how to use swap sets. * DurMod=## * Any spell extension percentage, e.g. 05 (for 5%), 25 (for 25%). * Due to how spell durations / extensions are calculated, you may need to enter extensions in excessive of 100% (e.g. a 25% extension would be entered here as 125). Check your results in game to make sure you have set the correct extension. * SpellAlias=spell alias * Enter an \"alias\" for the spell. This is often a short, easier to use name (e.g. the alias for Spirit of the Wolf might be SoW). Please note that you can NOT have spaces in your alias names. Announce=channel Channel to announce in, or leave blank for no announce. See ACAnnounce description in the AdvMelee section for further explanation. Annoucements also support formatting (makes it a bit easier to see in the MQ window). For example: Announce=/bc [+r+]Buffed +x+ \\<\\< +y+ %t +x+ >> with +g+ %s [+x+] SpellMinMana=# Minimum mana percentage to have in order to attempt this spell (e.g. 05 \\(for 5%\\) , 25 (for 25%) TarCnt=# Designate how many targets are required to cast this spell. If set to 0, this spell will not be auto-casted. This is useful for spells that you want to call via alias to be cast manually. For single cast spells (e.g. Spirit of Eagle), TarCnt will most often be set to 1. For group spells (e.g. Flight of Eagles), you might set your TarCnt higher so that it only gets cast when there are more than 2 or 3 people in your group. * TarType=target type * Valid target types are as follows (please note which entries can be used with others and which are exclusive): * ShortClassName Used for class specific buffs (ie. haste on \"war\"). Valid entries are: war shd pal rng mnk rog brd bst ber shm clr dru wiz mag enc nec. Note that any or all of these entries can be used at the same time. self Used for self only spells. grp for Group spells (e.g. TarType=self grp) pet used to cast buffs on all pets in the group. mypet used to cast on only your pet. Please note that pet and mypet are mutually exclusive. cbt for spells to be casted during combat (e.g. an entry for Yaulp would be TarType=self cbt). Please note that any NPC within radius that is not on your exclude list will cause 'cbt' buffs to fire. If you want to buff next to NPCs (and don't plan to kill them), use the exclude command. If you later decide to kill whatever mob you've excluded, use the include command to remove it from list. The macro does not check combat state of the tank for buffs. idle used with cbt for spells to be casted when in or out of combat (e.g. if you wanted to keep Yaulp on at all times (in AND out of combat), your entry would be TarType=self cbt idle). Please note that idle is only used in TarType when cbt is also used. aura used to cast an aura - must be used with self (e.g. TarType=self aura) Note that Bard auras *REQUIRE* SpellAlias to be set up to cast, and modbuff will use CastCall to actually cast the aura. * tank used to cast only on the designated group tank. Tank designation is keyed from either the TankName variable in the setting section (see above) or by setting a toon to Main Tank (Group.Maintank) using the Roles function. petspell used to set up an entry to create/cast a pet. Example: ''[AB3] Gem=7 Spell=Shambling Minion SpellFoci= DurMod=0 SpellAlias=pet Announce=/bc Cooking up a pet SpellMinMana=10 TarCnt=1 TarType= petspell Recast=FALSE SpellIcon= PreCondition=TRUE'' Default entry: *TarType=tank war shd pal rng mnk rog brd bst ber shm clr dru wiz mag enc nec self mypet grp pet cbt idle* Please note that the default entry includes settings that do not work together. Specifically, tank , self and mypet are meant to be used by themselves. If you want to cast the same buff on yourself, your pet and the tank, create them as seperate buff entries. * Recast=TRUE|FALSE * True is only really needed for single targets that are NOT in the group and/or on NetBots. Set Recast TRUE when you want the macro to use the spell worn off messages from EQ for the macro to know who to cast the buff on. This allows you to rebuff toons that are lower level for your normal buff set, or not in EQBC and not in group. For the most part this shouldn't be needed for rebuffing if all of your toons are NetBots members. The macro actually checks the other toons in netbots and knows what their buffs are, whether the one they're trying to cast will stack, and the duration of the buff if the toon still has it on. * SpellIcon=icon name * Use when the spell icon has a different name than the actual spell (e.g. the spell Unity of Spirits has a spell icon of Transcendent Foresight . In fact, you could use any one of the four spell icons/names that Unity creates). Please note that if the name you have in SpellIcon doesn't evaluate to a spell name, the buff will be skipped. In other words, leave it blank if your spell doesn't need it. AdvEvent Section [AdvEvent] \u00b6 AECount=# Number of events you plan to have. AECheckTime=# How often to check for events in seconds AECustomX=watch text Custom emote-triggered events driven by scripts. Default is three blank entries (AECustom1=, AECustom2=, AECustom3=) Please note that an earlier version of this variable populated AECustom1, AECustom2 and AECustom3 with random numbers in the ini file. The newwer version of AECustom now adds the three AECustomX entries but sets them as blank.) Each AECustomX entry, if defined, must have a corresponding script entry. For example, by defining AECustom1=greater bloodmoon healing in the AdvEvent section, you would need a corresponding script defined that might read something like: [Script-AECustomEvent1] Commands=1 C1=/bc cast stun AEGem[x]=source Designate what the source of the spell is. Valid entries: gem number, alt, ability, item, script, potionbelt Note that 'potionbelt' does not require a slot number. Examples: AEGem1=3 Cast this spell from gem 3 AEGem1=alt This spell is an alternative advancement ability AESpell[x]=source name Valid entries: spell name, item name, alternate ability name, ability name, script name Examples: AESpell1=Minor Shielding This would be generally be paired with an ABGem1 entry indicating which spell gem to cast Minor Shielding from. AESpell1=Uber Wand Thingy of Uberness This would be generally be paired with an AEGem1 entry indicating that the source of this spell is an item. * AESpellFoci[x]=setname * Bandolier set name to swap in before casting this spell. * Please see MQ2Bandolier and MQ2Cast to understand how to use swap sets. * AEDurMod[x]=## * Any spell extension percentage, e.g. 05 (for 5%), 25 (for 25%). * Due to how spell durations / extensions are calculated, you may need to enter extensions in excessive of 100% (e.g. a 25% extension would be entered here as 125).

This is often a short, easier to use name (e.g. the alias for Spirit of the Wolf might be SoW). Please note that you can NOT have spaces in your alias names. AEAnnounce[x]=channel Channel to announce in, or leave blank for no announce. See ACAnnounce description in the AdvMelee section for further explanation.

For example: ABAnnounce1=/bc [+r+]Buffed +x+ \\<\\< +y+ %t +x+ >> with +g+ %s [+x+] AETarCnt[x]=1|0 Settings are *only* either 1 (on) or 0 (off). Examples \u00b6 Shaman cannibalization example.

The first cure in your .ini matching the cure type needed (or if you set to \"All\") will be the first attempted spell. Cures *can* always be interrupted by any heal spell, unless you're using a cure spell that's already listed in your heal section (e.g. Cleric's \"Word of XXX\" line of spells may or may not interrupt for heals depending on where they are in your heal section). Modcure.inc will cast once per loop and then return to the main loop, so setting group cures (like Radiant Cure) toward the top would be best Be specific on cure types to avoid recasting the same cure over and over if it won't cure you. SpellMinMana=# Minimum mana to have in order to attempt this cure. SpellRecast=# Number of times to recast this spell for fizzles, interrupts, etc. TarCnt=# How many targets should be present to cast this spell, if set to 0, this spell will not be auto-casted. TarType=target type Valid target types are as follows (please note which entries can be used with others and which are exclusive): ShortClassName Used for class specific buffs (ie. haste on \"war\"). Valid entries are: war shd pal rng mnk rog brd bst ber shm clr dru wiz mag enc nec. Note that any or all of these entries can be used at the same time. self Used for self only spells. grp for Group spells (e.g. ABTarType1=self grp) pet used to cast buffs on all pets in the group. mypet used to cast on only your pet. Please note that pet and mypet are mutually exclusive. cbt for spells to be casted during combat (e.g. an entry for Yaulp would be TarType=self cbt). Please note that any NPC within radius that is not on your exclude list will cause 'cbt' buffs to fire. If you want to buff next to NPCs (and don't plan to kill them), use the exclude command.

This is often a short, easier to use name (e.g. the alias for Radiant Cure might be RC). Please note that you can NOT have spaces in your alias names. Announce=channel Channel to announce in, or leave blank for no announce. See ACAnnounce description in the AdvMelee section for further explanation. Annoucements also support formatting (makes it a bit easier to see in the MQ window). For example: Announce=/bc [+r+]Cured +x+ \\<\\< +y+ %t +x+ >> with +g+ %s [+x+] [AQ2] Gem=2 Spell=Counteract Disease SpellCntr=0 SpellFoci= SpellCureType=Diseased Slowed SpellMinMana=0 SpellRecast=0 TarCnt=1 TarType=pc grp pet cbt idle SpellAlias= Announce=/bc AdvPull Section [AdvPull] \u00b6 This section is under development. APCheckTime=# Time (in seconds) to wait in between AdvPull executions. Default is 0. APRadius=# The distance around your target to check for more mobs as defined by APMobMax (basically, a check for adds). Default is 40. * APMobMax=# * The max amount of mobs (target + adds) you will allow before pulling. Default is 1. If there are less than APMobMax mobs within APRadius of your target, it will pull the mob. * APScript= Scriptname * Name of script to define how you want to tag the mob (throw stone, ranged, item clicky, spell, etc) and executes when you have a mob targeted to pull. The script name must have at least 3 characters. Default is empty. **YOU MUST CREATE A SCRIPT TO TAG THE MOB!** Modbot Scripts APPath= Pathname The name of the path to run for pulling/movement, as defined in your MBWayPnt.ini (See ModMove for more details on creating a path). The path name must be at least 3 characters. Default is empty. * APRetPath= ReturnPathname * The name of the path to use to move back to camp. The path must be defined in your MBWayPnt.ini file. The path name must be at least 3 characters. Default is empty. Mostly used for when the path back to camp is a different one than used to pull mobs (ie, you go through a one-way wall to pull or intentionally fall off a ledge and have to run the long way back). If you want to return the same way you came, you can just use WPLoop=TRUE in MBWayPnt.ini instead of having to set up a second path. * APBefore= * Command or series of commands (with multiline) to execute before the rest of AdvPull section. Must be at least 3 characters. Default is empty. * APAfter= * Command or series of commands (with multiline) to execute after AdvPull has finished. Default is empty. * APAnnounce= * A way to announce what you have pulled. Default is empty. * Note: This is not just a chat channel, but a place to put a full incoming message, ie: * APAnnounce=/gsay Incoming -[ %t ]- * APRetries=1 * Number of times to attempt to pull a mob in case it fails the first try (line of site, etc). This will strafe left and right on subsequent attempts. Default is 1. MBCommon.inc Settings \u00b6 The location and name of MBCommon.inc can now be set by changing line 38 in Modbot.mac. /declare MBCommon string outer MBCommon.ini It defaults to the ./macros folder, but the line can be changed to any path. Settings Section \u00b6 LoadAlias [1,0] This is an on / off setting to load the \"/alias /mb /echo MB-\" alias for commands. It is set to 0 after first run when alias should be loaded, but you can set to 1 to add it back to your Macroquest.ini file if it gets deleted. IniLocation Path to your MB_.ini files. Must end in / or if changed from default. LootIni [Loot.ini] This setting can be used to change the location of your Loot.ini file as well as the name. MBWayPntLocation [MBWayPnt.ini] This setting can be used to change the location of your MBWayPnt.ini file as well as the name of the file. CheckTargetDebuffs [TRUE|FALSE] This setting toggles on/off the ${Target.Buff} checking for debuffs (essentially this checks if the spell \"Stacks\" before casting.) Each debuff listed in MBCommon.ini now has an 'OverwritesID=' entry. This entry is meant for a list of debuffs that the spell doesn't 'Stack' with, but you want the debuff to overwrite. Spell Section \u00b6 Zone.ShortName - List of mobs excluded for that zone in a pipe -\"|\" delimited string. This setting is not present for any zones which you have nothing excluded. Immune lists for each spell are saved in their own section along with a MaxLevel=[100] setting. Change to the max level of the spell. As the macro finds mobs that are immune to the spell, the zone shortname is added to the entry as a variable along with the mob names in pipe delimited format. Mobs that are marked immune to debuffs can be marked in MBCommon.ini with an asterisk to allow for some names that have only some immune, and some not. For example, Dreadspire has some body types with same names where some are immune to mez, and some not (e.g. an aid to the Seneschal - some body types with that mob name are immune to befuddle, and others aren't). By adding an asterisk to the end of the name in the exclude section, the macro will repeat attempts to mez, etc. that mob type (rather than just marking them immune and not casting at all): _DreadspireImmune=|an aid to the Seneschal_|* The ADIfSpellImmune script, if defined, will only run if the mob is found to be immune after cast, but the astrik will not be replaced, and the spell will only cast once allowing the spell to still attempt on the next mob it hasn't been cast on. Overwrites= list of debuffs that the spell doesn't 'Stack' with, but you want the debuff to overwrite. This does require user intervention, and there's no way to set it auto-set them. MaxLevel= maximum level of mob that can be affected by debuff An entry in the spell section might look something like this: [Mystify] MaxLevel=83 thalassius_bImmune=|a sea mephit defender||a sea mephit evoker| OverwritesID=|14569|14570|14530| ModBot Class INI Examples \u00b6 ModBot`` ``Class`` ``INI`` ``Examples`` ``linked`` ``to`` ``another`` ``page Scripts and ModBot Variable Usage \u00b6 ModBot allows VERY customizable sripts to such an extent you can actually program your own sub-procedures within your INI file. You can harness ANY global variable within ModBot to use with the scripts. Scripts match MQ2 code to every extent, below are several examples of scripts and common variables one would use to create complex scripts Understanding scripts, syntax, example, how to \u00b6 Scripts General Info Scripts can be difficult and there are some MQ2 commands that give scripts trouble. Keep this in mind and prepare to post you script code should you have problems. No script can take more then 15 seconds to complete, however this can be modified in the code directly in the Sub MBScript or even changed in the script you create ({Timer} is the var) Scripts are executed from top to bottom and you are allowed to use a label :Top (e.g. /goto :Top), in your script. The /goto :Top option allows for complex loops to take place directly from code in the INI file If you use ANY INI generated ModBot global string variables that have spaces in your custom scripts they MUST be encapsulated by 2 apostrophies when used in the script, see PetCast example below. * Reserved Characters :*These characters can not be used in scripts ::*$ \" :*'' Two apostrophies are for passing variables with spaces in script code.

You must restart the ModBot macro after executing the addbuff command in order to complete the adding of the buff entry. The Spellname, etc. section can be entered directly (e.g. */mb addbuff \"Bone Mask of the Ancient Iksar|item\" iksar self_) or, if adding a clicky, by holding the item on your cursor (e.g._ /mb addbuff \"${Cursor.Name}|item\" iksar self*). Please note that the quotes around the spellname|gem section are required. ABTarType will accept multiple targets if quotes are used (e.g. */mb addbuff \"Levitiation|gem1\" levi \"war mnk rog\"*). addbuff execution will add ABGem, ABSpell, ABSpellAlias and ABTarType entries to the characters INI file. The remaining buff lines (ABSpellFociX, ABDurModX, etc.) will be added once you restart the ModBot macro (the array size change (ABCount) will also not increment until after re-start).

If you want to force an exclude you must edit the INI file and place a \"#\" in front of the mobs name (e.g. ExcludeList=a dusty barrel|a dark coffin|#a bitten victim|a hollow tree|, this will always force \"a bitten victim\" to be on the exclude list) Use the following commands from a character to add mobs to the exclude list (Kroak suggested just tossing this in a two-line hotkey): /bcaa //mb exclude ${Target.CleanName} Will write the exclusion to a string that is checked through the debuff loop /bcaa //mb exclude save Will write the exclusion in the mbcommon.ini and that exclusion includes the zone id, so mobs of the same name in a different zone are NOT excluded. You shouldn't have to re-run the macro after an exclude but if you do this in the midst of comabat or something, while mobs are near, it may not \"take\" as quickly. For mob names with spaces in them, simply enter the name without any quotations.

Check your results in game to make sure you have set the correct extension. * SpellAlias=spell alias * Enter an \"alias\" for the spell. This is often a short, easier to use name (e.g. the alias for Spirit of the Wolf might be SoW). Please note that you can NOT have spaces in your alias names. Announce=channel Channel to announce in, or leave blank for no announce. See ACAnnounce description in the AdvMelee section for further explanation. Annoucements also support formatting (makes it a bit easier to see in the MQ window). For example: Announce=/bc [+r+]Buffed +x+ \\<\\< +y+ %t +x+ >> with +g+ %s [+x+] SpellMinMana=# Minimum mana percentage to have in order to attempt this spell (e.g. 05 \\(for 5%\\) , 25 (for 25%) TarCnt=# Designate how many targets are required to cast this spell. If set to 0, this spell will not be auto-casted. This is useful for spells that you want to call via alias to be cast manually. For single cast spells (e.g. Spirit of Eagle), TarCnt will most often be set to 1. For group spells (e.g. Flight of Eagles), you might set your TarCnt higher so that it only gets cast when there are more than 2 or 3 people in your group. * TarType=target type * Valid target types are as follows (please note which entries can be used with others and which are exclusive): * ShortClassName Used for class specific buffs (ie. haste on \"war\"). Valid entries are: war shd pal rng mnk rog brd bst ber shm clr dru wiz mag enc nec. Note that any or all of these entries can be used at the same time. self Used for self only spells. grp for Group spells (e.g. TarType=self grp) pet used to cast buffs on all pets in the group. mypet used to cast on only your pet. Please note that pet and mypet are mutually exclusive. cbt for spells to be casted during combat (e.g. an entry for Yaulp would be TarType=self cbt). Please note that any NPC within radius that is not on your exclude list will cause 'cbt' buffs to fire. If you want to buff next to NPCs (and don't plan to kill them), use the exclude command. If you later decide to kill whatever mob you've excluded, use the include command to remove it from list. The macro does not check combat state of the tank for buffs. idle used with cbt for spells to be casted when in or out of combat (e.g. if you wanted to keep Yaulp on at all times (in AND out of combat), your entry would be TarType=self cbt idle). Please note that idle is only used in TarType when cbt is also used. aura used to cast an aura - must be used with self (e.g. TarType=self aura) Note that Bard auras *REQUIRE* SpellAlias to be set up to cast, and modbuff will use CastCall to actually cast the aura. * tank used to cast only on the designated group tank. Tank designation is keyed from either the TankName variable in the setting section (see above) or by setting a toon to Main Tank (Group.Maintank) using the Roles function. petspell used to set up an entry to create/cast a pet. Example: ''[AB3] Gem=7 Spell=Shambling Minion SpellFoci= DurMod=0 SpellAlias=pet Announce=/bc Cooking up a pet SpellMinMana=10 TarCnt=1 TarType= petspell Recast=FALSE SpellIcon= PreCondition=TRUE'' Default entry: *TarType=tank war shd pal rng mnk rog brd bst ber shm clr dru wiz mag enc nec self mypet grp pet cbt idle* Please note that the default entry includes settings that do not work together. Specifically, tank , self and mypet are meant to be used by themselves. If you want to cast the same buff on yourself, your pet and the tank, create them as seperate buff entries. * Recast=TRUE|FALSE * True is only really needed for single targets that are NOT in the group and/or on NetBots. Set Recast TRUE when you want the macro to use the spell worn off messages from EQ for the macro to know who to cast the buff on. This allows you to rebuff toons that are lower level for your normal buff set, or not in EQBC and not in group. For the most part this shouldn't be needed for rebuffing if all of your toons are NetBots members. The macro actually checks the other toons in netbots and knows what their buffs are, whether the one they're trying to cast will stack, and the duration of the buff if the toon still has it on. * SpellIcon=icon name * Use when the spell icon has a different name than the actual spell (e.g. the spell Unity of Spirits has a spell icon of Transcendent Foresight . In fact, you could use any one of the four spell icons/names that Unity creates). Please note that if the name you have in SpellIcon doesn't evaluate to a spell name, the buff will be skipped. In other words, leave it blank if your spell doesn't need it.","title":"AdvBuff Section [AdvBuff]"},{"location":"macros/gallery/modbot-4.0/#advevent-section-advevent","text":"AECount=# Number of events you plan to have.

This script does require the clerics to all be running modbot with an alias of CH for complete heal spell, `and connection to the same EQBCS server. `Commands=13` `C1=/multiline ; /declare clrlist string local;/declare x int local 1;/declare StopLoop bool local FALSE` `C2=/if ({Spawn[{NetBots.Client.Arg[{x}]}].Class.ShortName.Equal[clr]}) /varset clrlist {clrlist} {NetBots.Client.Arg[{x}]}` `C3=/if ({x} < {NetBots.Counts}) /multiline ; /varset a 1;/varcalc x {x}+1` `C4=/echo Clerics: {clrlist} casting {Math.Calc[{Param1}/10]}s apart` `C5=/varset x 0` `C6=/varset Timer 100` `C7=/varcalc x {x}+1` `C8=/if ((!{Spawn[{clrlist.Arg[{x}]}].ID} || {NetBots[{clrlist.Arg[{x}]}].PctMana} < 3) && {x} <= {clrlist.Count[ ]}) /varset a 5` `C9=/if ((!{Spawn[{clrlist.Arg[{x}]}].ID} || {NetBots[{clrlist.Arg[{x}]}].PctMana} < 3) && {x} > {clrlist.Count[ ]}) /varset a 4` `C10=/bc {clrlist.Arg[{x}]} cast ch` `C11=/delay {Param1}` `C12=/if ({x}>{clrlist.Count[ ]}) /varset a 4` `C13=/if (!{StopLoop}) /varset a 5` ````` Posted By Ptarp Tue Apr 12, 2011 1:01 am.

Please keep this note in the back of your mind as you work with the Wiki - if you come across a command, etc. that will just not seem to work for you (and you have already thoroughly researched it, checked syntax, re-checked syntax, etc.), please take a moment to check your version of the module that it applies to - you may need to update. Using the SVN Repository \u00b6 For those of you that would like to use the beta files off of the SVN repository, you have two options - use your browser to grab files or use a tool like TortoiseSVN to automate the process a bit. Using the browser is pretty self-explanatory, but TortoiseSVN requires a bit of set up. This process covers what is needed for the Windows version: Links to the browser access and to SVN can be found at the bottom of this post.. http://www.macroquest.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=49&t=15313 Download and install [ http://tortoisesvn.net/downloads.html TortoiseSVN ]. Create a folder on your system where you want to store the downloaded ModBot files. Right click on your newly created folder and select SVN Checkout (right above the TortoiseSVN entry). In the menu that comes up, input the URL of repository and then click OK. Once you've clicked OK, the folder will populate with everything on SVN. Any time you want to update the folder to newest revision, simply right click on the folder and select SVN Update from the Tortoise menu. How To \u00b6 To use ModBot Extract and place all included files from zip (all .mac and .inc files) into your MQ2 macro directory. From inside EQ, type /macro modbot (e.g. /macro modbot OR /macro modbot raidmode). This will build, if it doesn't exist, your MB_.ini file. Optional entries will make a MB__.ini. Being shrouded on startup without using an option will use your race and class for the creation of an MB__.ini file. From inside EQ, end the macro by typing /endmac Tab out of EQ, locate your new MB_.ini file in your macro directory, and open it. You can use the editor of your choice, but Notepad will work just fine. For every component of the macro you want to use, increase the respective \"count\", if you want two heals, set AHCount=2, if you want 2 debuffs, set ADCount=2, etc. After you have set your counts, save and close the INI file. Tab back over into EQ and restart the macro (/macro modbot). This will now populate your INI file based on the count entries that you made in the previous step End the macro again by typing /endmac Open the INI file once more and \"tweak\" the newly created entries to fit your needs. When you are done, save and close the INI file. Tab back over to EQ and restart the macro. Your bot should now be just that, a BOT and will listen to your every command (assuming you are the master). For examples of complete class ModBot INI files, please go to the example INI page . Please Note!! One thing to keep in mind throughout the configuration of the ModBot INI file: keep your most critical and most used spells, activities, etc., first in their respective INI sections. You don't want your mez spell as Debuff number 20, you don't want slow as debuff 10, you don't want a CBT based buff as buff 23, and you don't want CH as heal 1 (you want your most desperate heal as heal 1), etc. Configure your heals, buffs, debuffs, etc. in a highest priority first order.

probably most common but check out the EQBC Forum thread for more methods / features. You can also configure an alias so you can run modbot on the character you control and execute ModBot commands. To create the alias you must run this from the EQ prompt: /alias /mb /echo mb- Or change the LoadAlias variable in MBCommon.inc [Settings] section from 0 to 1 if you've lost the alias in your Macroquest.ini With this alias you can tell your bot locally what to do: /mb makecamp /mb buffup /mb letsroll /mb Command Reference \u00b6 Section Updated: June 7, 2009 abort (Interrupts any cast in progress, Sets - DoHeals, DoDebuffs & DoMelee FALSE and follows the sender closely, usefull when you want to RUN away) addbuff \"\\|\\\" ABSpellAlias ABTarType (Adds a new buff entry to the character's INI file.) You must restart the ModBot macro after executing the addbuff command in order to complete the adding of the buff entry. The Spellname, etc. section can be entered directly (e.g. */mb addbuff \"Bone Mask of the Ancient Iksar|item\" iksar self_) or, if adding a clicky, by holding the item on your cursor (e.g._ /mb addbuff \"${Cursor.Name}|item\" iksar self*). Please note that the quotes around the spellname|gem section are required. ABTarType will accept multiple targets if quotes are used (e.g. */mb addbuff \"Levitiation|gem1\" levi \"war mnk rog\"*). addbuff execution will add ABGem, ABSpell, ABSpellAlias and ABTarType entries to the characters INI file. The remaining buff lines (ABSpellFociX, ABDurModX, etc.) will be added once you restart the ModBot macro (the array size change (ABCount) will also not increment until after re-start). For example, using these Bonemask example command, the following entires will be added to the INI file (where \"X\" is equal to whatever the next numbered entry is in your advbuff section): ABGemX=item ABSpellX=Bone Mask of the Ancient Iksar ABSpellAliasX=iksar ABTarTypeX=self attack (Sets DoMelee TRUE and forces bot to attack the TankName's target) attack (Sets DoMelee TRUE and forces bot to attack the target) * Note: OffTank must be TRUE to use this option (I may remove this requirement though TBD) * Example 1 - /bc attack badguy * Example 2 = /bc attack badguy 100 20 buffup (This will set DoBuffs & DoEvents TRUE & DoHeals FALSE) campout (Performs a /camp desktop and ends the macro) cast <on/off> (This will disable or enable the spell associated with this alias) cast [<spawnname/id> \\<%t> ] [<spawnname/id> \\<%t> ] (infinte) If the spell is detrimental, CAST targets the requester's target. If the spell is beneficial, it targets the sender or, if grp is present, it casts buff on group members. If %t is present, it targets the requester's target. The cast command will ignore INI settings for things like minmana, maxmana, recasts, buff debuff counters, etc. This command is mainly used for manual, \"one off\" type casts. Example 1 - /bc cast buffhp grp haste bob haste jane dmgshld bob Example 2 - /bc cast dmgshld bob nuke tash Example 3 - /bc cast slow \"nasty add\" doafk [on, true, off, false, ] dobuffbot [on, true, off, false, ] (Places the bot in \"BuffBot Mode\". Currently once set to on or true, it will NOT turn off and you MUST restart the macro to \"quit\" this mode. It will cast any spell alias on the requesting target. The requester must be a \"master\". Example: /t buffhp dobuffs [on, true, off, false, ] docombines (Toggle that turns docombines on/off (default off). Docombines will check for an open tradeskill window with an enabled combine button (you have to select recipe), and will click the button.

See the instructions on forums.) doquest [on,true,off,false] (Default is TRUE. If set to FALSE, your looter will ignore items marked \"quest\" and still loot other items.) Can be used to add quest items to your loot.ini file. For example, while holding an item on cursor, */mb doquest 4 Hair of the Dog* will set the item you're holding to \"=Quest|4|Hair of the Dog|\" in loot.ini. Can also be used in conjunction with the QuestOnly variable (found in the setting section of the loot.ini file). If both doquest and QuestOnly are set to TRUE, your toon will only loot quest items. Also note that if QuestOnly is set to TRUE and doquest is set to FALSE, your toon will only loot cash off of mobs.

Useful for tells in background sessions) **exclude ** (Adds to alert list, to save list you must use the \"save\" option, otherwise it will not be written to the INI file) The exclude list is dynamic and will only exclude mobs that are present in the zone AND that are on the list. If you want to force an exclude you must edit the INI file and place a \"#\" in front of the mobs name (e.g. ExcludeList=a dusty barrel|a dark coffin|#a bitten victim|a hollow tree|, this will always force \"a bitten victim\" to be on the exclude list) Use the following commands from a character to add mobs to the exclude list (Kroak suggested just tossing this in a two-line hotkey): /bcaa //mb exclude ${Target.CleanName} Will write the exclusion to a string that is checked through the debuff loop /bcaa //mb exclude save Will write the exclusion in the mbcommon.ini and that exclusion includes the zone id, so mobs of the same name in a different zone are NOT excluded. You shouldn't have to re-run the macro after an exclude but if you do this in the midst of comabat or something, while mobs are near, it may not \"take\" as quickly. For mob names with spaces in them, simply enter the name without any quotations. For example: ''/bcaa //mb exclude a small bat See the Include command (found below) to temporarily remove a mob from the alert list follow (Follows the sender or ) follow close (Follows the sender within 3 steps, very close) give (Calls the sub GiveCheck to hand an item to a toon or NPC.) ItemCount is optional and will default to 1. The give command can be used in conjunction with categories that have been defined in the loot.ini. For instance, if you have items marked 'SpellScroll' in your loot.ini, and the Category variable has \"SpellScroll\" included, you can issue the give command as follows: /mb give Bob SpellScroll TRUE . The result will be that all items on your toon that are marked with that category (SpellScroll) in your loot.ini will be handed to Bob.) * goto (Bot will move to the loc given) * handin (Target an NPC or PC, get one item on your cursor, and all of that item will be handed to them and trade or give button pressed.) holdup (This will set DoBuffs,DoDebuffs,DoEvents,DoMelee all to FALSE) include (Removes from alert list, this will not save to the INI file, see exclude save) letsroll (This will set DoBuffs,DoHeals,DoMelee,DoEvents,DoDebuffs TRUE) makecamp (This will Makecamp at existing location.

Once started, ducking for each location will add a waypoint to the path. Sitting stops path recording and returns to modbot functions. To add doors, chains, pull locations, etc. you'll need to edit the MBWayPlay.INI file Further information about mbwayplay and mbwayrec (along with examples) can be found here in the wiki. * offtank <on/off> (Toggles offtanking for dealing with adds.) * script (This will allow you to run custom commands while the macro is running, or combine series of commands, see script examples in manual / rev notes) sell (You must be within range of a merchant in order to function, it will sell loot marked as \"=SELL\" in the loot.ini file) sell (With NPC targeted will attempt to sell all items marked \"sell\" in your lootIni file to target. Otherwise optional target name can be supplied.) setinivar (This will find and change any setting in your .ini) Note that this command will have trouble with script settings if you have more than one (it will set the first C1= or whatever that it comes to. Variables changed in the .ini are /varset with the macro running Spells, gems, etc. will not be set unless you use the array correctly for . In other words, ADGem[1] is not the same as ADGem1: Use ADGem[1] and this will set the ADGem1 .ini setting and varset the change to memory. Use ADGem1 and it will only change the .ini. This still has a problem finding variables in very long sections. If /echo \\({Ini\\[\\) , ]} is over the MAX_STRING value - (You go LD typing that if it is). - Stuff like ABGem[20] is almost never found. (Still working on that.) For example, Ligament Slice for a rogue was set up from in-game with these commands typed in to the MQ window (and the rogue was able to put it immediately to use): /mb setinivar ADCount 4 (restart macro - had 0 count before) /mb setinivar ADGem[1] alt /mb setinivar ADSpell[1] Ligament Slice /mb setinivar ADTarBegHP[1] 40 /mb setinivar ADTarCnt[1] 1 /mb setinivar ADTarType[1] 1 /mb setinivar ADAnnounce[1] /bc /mb setinivar ADSpellAlias[1] snare sing (Will sing this song and add the respective gem number to the Twist.List, it attempts to use detrimental as the qualifier to add it to combat songs, or rest songs) stop (Will stop following and/or stop in place) sung (Will remove this song from the respective Twist.List, it attempts to use detrimental as the qualifier to remove it from combat songs, or rest songs) ModBot in game usage and commands \u00b6 Example commands: /bc Bob follow me [This tells bob and only bob to follow me] /bc cast dd [this tells every bot to cast the spell alias dd] /bc shamandude cast buffsta grp buffhp focus grp buffhp %T [buffsta on the group, buffhp on the requester, focus on the group, buffhp on requesters target] /bc necroguy makecamp [this tells \"necroguy\" to makecamp] /bc campout [tells all bots to camp to desktop] /bc exclude ${Target.CleanName} [tells all bots to add your target to the exclude / ignore list, toons will not attack any spawn with that name.] /bc clericname dobuffs on [tells the cleric to set DoBuffs to true and will then begin buffing group] /bc pallyguy cast bmb %t buffhp grp [bmb on requesters target, buffhp on the group] Typical commands sequence for an EXP group: /bc letsroll /bc makecamp You then begin to pull mobs and they will react accordingly. Mobile Camp Example: /bc follow /bc buffup [once ready zone into the instance] /bc stop /bc letsroll [clear first room lets say] /bc follow [move to next room] /bc makecamp [etc, repeat] Example movement options with or without invis /bc mbp on /bc follow Make a EQBC Channel and do things like (using this technique you don't even have to be a master) /bct mycoolchannelname //mb letsroll /bct mycoolchannelname //mb campout ModBot INI Settings \u00b6 PreFace Notes \u00b6 Spell Alias's must be unique across all alias's Obsolete? 06272011 -Changed - ? \"cast\" command usage now allows for multiple aliases. If you have several spells with the same alias, using /bc castwill now cast all spells marked. Example, for shaman you can have Fo7, Talisman of Boar, Talisman of Wrulan, Talisman of Tribunal, ect.. all marked with \"fullgroup\". \"/mb cast fullgroup\" will cast each spell in the order they are found in the .ini file. Buffing -```Group buffs can now be seperated to different classes, and will allow keeping the spell on netbots members in seperate groups from the caster with the inclusion of keyword \"raid\". Example -` `ABSpell2=Focus of the Seventh` `ABSpellFoci2=` `ABDurMod2=50` `ABSpellAlias2=fo7|grpfocus|fullgroup` `ABAnnounce2=` `ABSpellMinMana2=20` `ABTarCnt2=2` `ABTarType2=war shd pal rng mnk rog brd bst ber shm dru wiz mag enc nec raid` `ABRecast2=FALSE` `ABSpellIcon2=` `ABPreCondition2=TRUE` ````` Note from the above example that clr is not included in the TarType.. My clerics have the spell blocked. Attempting to cast on them will cause a chain loop of ```casting until the cleric gets self buff on that doesn't \"stack\" with focus. - so watch spell stacking and make sure to set your toons accordingly.`` ````` Old format of \"self\" will also work with no change if you don't want to buff other groups with the spell. Commands - Tell commands will now check buff aliases, and don't need \"cast\" to ask for buffs.. \"/tellfullgroup\" from a non-master toon will make the shaman cast every spell with that alias on the sender of the tell. Masters still require use of \"cast\". - This does allow guildies or whoever else knows your aliases to get buffs easily. /say is not affected and is still not enabled for modbot. Added \"docommand\" -```Master toons that aren't in netbots can now directly command toons. \"/telldocommand /sit\" will make the receiving toon sit, or execute any command after the \"docommand\" keyword. - Word of caution - You can cause macro errors with this if you aren't careful. The command sent is executed directly with /docommand in the macro. `A tell received of \"/telldocommand /sit\" will locally execute \"/docommand /sit\" Watch extra characters and or brackets.. - Because of the nature of this one, the commanding toon MUST be listed in MasterList. You should be familiar or at least capable of making MQ2Bandolier sets as they are used by MQ2Cast for \"foci\" items Please treat the Buff, Debuff, Event, Heal INI sections as a first in first out (FIFO). Highest priority to lowest priority, you don't want mez or slow as ADSpell12 but as ADSpell1. You don't want AHHeal1 as Complete Heal, you want AHHeal1 to be DA/DB (those are examples, use common sense) If you want to add some visual zip to your announcements (things are easy to miss in /bc..), you can use color coding and the like in any of your Announce settings. For example, *ADAnnounce1=/bc [+r+]Group Mez[+x+] \\<\\<[+y+] %t +x+ >> with +g+ %s [+x+]* will produce a line in the MQ chat window that is MUCH easier to see than the regular fonts. Rk. XX Usage - Heals, buffs, debuffs, and cures have code added to check your book and find the correct version of the spell you're using on startup of modbot. Rk. II and Rk. III are not needed, but only for these sections. If you upgrade a normal spell in these sections to Rk. II or III, restarting the macro will make the new spell work. Please note that this does not apply to discs, potionbelt, abilities, or PetCast at this time (meaning you must include the Rk. XX in the spell name for these types). Setting spell duration modifications (AHDurMod, ADDurMod, ABDurMod, AEDurMod) - Use the following formula to determine what number to set your DurMod at: \\({Spell[X\\].Duration} \\* (\\) +${Spell[X].Duration}) == timer duration. So if you want a 25% extension on the timer, set durmod to 25 to make ${Spell[X].Duration} * 1.25 = timer. Modbot shouldn't re-cast if timer is still running.

AdvHeal Section [AdvHeal] \u00b6 Please note that for FD class toons and ${Group.Puller} - If they are out of ACLeash range and not FD, they will not be healed (to prevent aggro on group), but only if healer is not in 'combat' combatstate. If you have the newest NetBots from SVN, another check will be done on the NetBots[].CombatState that needs healing. If not in combat they will be healed. For group heal spells, you must set the AHTarCnt to something greater than 1 in order for the spell to evaluate correctly (and be used as a \"group\" heal when more than one member of the group requires healing). For instance, if you have AHTarCnt=3, then at least 3 members of your group will need to be below the HP level that you set in the AHClass line. A possible issue may arise when the cleric is in a loop state where a single heal is being fired \\(AHHealMode\\) - it may take a bit for it to realize the single heal should be stopped and the group heal cast instead. Depending on how you have it configured, the use of AHHealMode can force it to not even check the your group heal spell as it's being told to only check one \\(the single heal\\) . If this is the case (and not the desired result), perhaps use the group heal as the spell to check in AHHealMode. AHCount=# Number of heals you plan to have. AHCheckTime=# How often to check for heals in seconds. AHHealOOBC=TRUE|FALSE Do I heal characters outside of Netbots and EQBC (e.g. folks not running MQ2 or mercenaries.) AHHealOOBC Thinking of an english name for that setting, all that comes up is \"Heal Outside Of BC\". So, in other words, if the setting is FALSE, it won't heal anyone that's not on YOUR EQBC server with the netbots plugin set up correctly, even if they're in your group. That is why I recommend you connect all toons and run modbot on all of them at least once, even if you don't plan to run it as a regular thing for the other toons.. It assures the plugins are set correctly. If AHHealOOBC=TRUE, then modbot will heal group members and pets even if there's no netbots connection. Out of group healing can only be done by the macro if there's a netbots connection, or if the other toon is a master and uses the cast command via /tell. I do recommend AHHealOOBC=TRUE setting, but I still left the default FALSE so people could check their connections before setting TRUE.

Meaning - settings of 10, 11, and 12 need to be in top spells slots (ADGem1, ADGem2, etc) * ADTarBegHP[x]=# * The target must be equal or below this HP%. * ADTarEndHP[x]=# * The target must be equal or above this HP% * ADIfSpellImmune[x]=script name * This is meant to be a pointer to a quick, one line script that is executed when a mob is immune to the spell you have cast. If you need to do something complicated, other scripts can be called from it. 'Param1' is now passed as the immune target's ID. An example where this would be useful is for chanter mez: /bc {TankName} //multiline ; /varset ACMATarget {Param1};/target id {Param1} will make your toon target the immune mob even if he was on another mob at the time. * ADUseHoTT[x]=# * This will cause the macro to /target the mob and check TargetOfTarget before casting and delay # seconds before checking again if mob is skipped. If not a raid or group member, the macro will move on and recheck that mob for that debuff after the time has expired. Note that this will default to casting the debuff anyways if HoTT isn't available. * ADPreCondition[x]=one line script * Whatever statement you add to this line needs to /return TRUE. i.e. - ADPreCondition1=/if ({This} && {That}) /return TRUE. Only a TRUE return will allow the spell to cast, so script carefully, or leave the lines default.

I have the same spell set with ADTarType2=12 directly after this one to make sure he slows adds. (sometimes he pulls em too..) Everything else - mainly ACAssistPct is set to a lower value. Most around 95 or so. Buffs are a pita because if the debuff sub is called \\(it is called first\\) it won't cast the debuffs if there's any reason not to, then the macro runs through the whole buff loop before getting back to debuffs again.. Setting the ADTarBegHP at least over the level of all other functions at least attempts to keep the slow first. Also.. I find the macro works best if you always set your ACManaPct very low. Usually keep mine around 5 or so for every toon. I should change the default on that, but clearing targets and such is something your toon will do quite often if his mana is under that value.\" - Ptarp on the forums on Wed Mar 09, 2011 7:54 pm. (edited into Wiki by Arblis) AdvBuff Section [AdvBuff] \u00b6 If you want to cast single target buffs after group buffs, place all of your group buffs first. ABCount=# Number of buffs you plan to have. ABMobMax=# Max number of targets to track for buffs (do not include pets) ABCheckTime=# How often to check for buffs in seconds ABGem[x]=source Designate what the source of the spell is. Valid entries: gem number, alt, ability, item, script, potionbelt Note that 'potionbelt' does not require a slot number. Examples: ABGem1=3 Cast this spell from gem 3 ABGem1=alt This spell is an alternative advancement ability ABSpell[x]=source name Valid entries: spell name, item name, alternate ability name, ability name, script name Examples: ABSpell1=Minor Shielding This would be generally be paired with an ABGem1 entry indicating which spell gem to cast Minor Shielding from. ABSpell1=Uber Wand Thingy of Uberness This would be generally be paired with an ABGem1 entry indicating that the source of this spell is an item. * ABSpellFoci[x]=setname * Bandolier set name to swap in before casting this spell. * Please see MQ2Bandolier and MQ2Cast to understand how to use swap sets. * ABDurMod[x]=## * Any spell extension percentage, e.g. 05 (for 5%), 25 (for 25%). * Due to how spell durations / extensions are calculated, you may need to enter extensions in excessive of 100% (e.g. a 25% extension would be entered here as 125). Check your results in game to make sure you have set the correct extension. * ABSpellAlias[x]=spell alias * Enter an \"alias\" for the spell. This is often a short, easier to use name (e.g. the alias for Spirit of the Wolf might be SoW). Please note that you can NOT have spaces in your alias names. ABAnnounce[x]=channel Channel to announce in, or leave blank for no announce. See ACAnnounce description in the AdvMelee section for further explanation. Annoucements also support formatting (makes it a bit easier to see in the MQ window). For example: ABAnnounce1=/bc [+r+]Buffed +x+ \\<\\< +y+ %t +x+ >> with +g+ %s [+x+] ABSpellMinMana[x]=# Minimum mana percentage to have in order to attempt this spell (e.g. 05 \\(for 5%\\) , 25 (for 25%) ABTarCnt[x]=# Designate how many targets are required to cast this spell. If set to 0, this spell will not be auto-casted. This is useful for spells that you want to call via alias to be cast manually. For single cast spells (e.g. Spirit of Eagle), ABTarCnt will most often be set to 1. For group spells (e.g. Flight of Eagles), you might set your ABTarCnt higher so that it only gets cast when there are more than 2 or 3 people in your group. * ABTarType[x]=target type * Valid target types are as follows (please note which entries can be used with others and which are exclusive): * ShortClassName Used for class specific buffs (ie. haste on \"war\"). Valid entries are: war shd pal rng mnk rog brd bst ber shm clr dru wiz mag enc nec. Note that any or all of these entries can be used at the same time. self Used for self only spells. grp for Group spells (example needed, according to author self is mutually exclusive, so self grp won't work. grp can also not be the only target, so its safer to just list classes here!) pet used to cast buffs on all pets in the group. mypet used to cast on only your pet. Please note that pet and mypet are mutually exclusive. cbt for spells to be casted during combat (e.g. an entry for Yaulp would be ABTarType1=self cbt). Please note that any NPC within radius that is not on your exclude list will cause 'cbt' buffs to fire. If you want to buff next to NPCs (and don't plan to kill them), use the exclude command. If you later decide to kill whatever mob you've excluded, use the include command to remove it from list. The macro does not check combat state of the tank for buffs. idle used with cbt for spells to be casted when in or out of combat (e.g. if you wanted to keep Yaulp on at all times (in AND out of combat), your entry would be ABTarType1=self cbt idle). Please note that idle is only used in ABTarType when cbt is also used. aura used to cast an aura - must be used with self (e.g. ABTarType1=self aura) Note that Bard auras *REQUIRE* ABSpellAlias to be set up to cast, and modbuff will use CastCall to actually cast the aura. * tank used to cast only on the designated group tank. Tank designation is keyed from either the TankName variable in the setting section (see above) or by setting a toon to Main Tank (Group.Maintank) using the Roles function. petspell used to set up an entry to create/cast a pet. Example: ''ABGem3=7 ABSpell3=Shambling Minion ABSpellFoci3= ABDurMod3=0 ABSpellAlias3=pet ABAnnounce3=/bc Cooking up a pet ABSpellMinMana3=10 ABTarCnt3=1 ABTarType3= petspell ABRecast3=FALSE ABSpellIcon3= ABPreCondition3=TRUE'' Default entry: *ABTarTypeX=tank war shd pal rng mnk rog brd bst ber shm clr dru wiz mag enc nec self mypet grp pet cbt idle* Please note that the default entry includes settings that do not work together. Specifically, tank , self and mypet are meant to be used by themselves. If you want to cast the same buff on yourself, your pet and the tank, create them as seperate buff entries. * ABRecast[x]=TRUE|FALSE * True is only really needed for single targets that are NOT in the group and/or on NetBots. Set ABRecast TRUE when you want the macro to use the spell worn off messages from EQ for the macro to know who to cast the buff on. This allows you to rebuff toons that are lower level for your normal buff set, or not in EQBC and not in group. For the most part this shouldn't be needed for rebuffing if all of your toons are NetBots members. The macro actually checks the other toons in netbots and knows what their buffs are, whether the one they're trying to cast will stack, and the duration of the buff if the toon still has it on. * ABSpellIcon[x]=icon name * Use when the spell icon has a different name than the actual spell (e.g. the spell Unity of Spirits has a spell icon of Transcendent Foresight . In fact, you could use any one of the four spell icons/names that Unity creates). Please note that if the name you have in ABSpellIcon doesn't evaluate to a spell name, the buff will be skipped. In other words, leave it blank if your spell doesn't need it. AdvEvent Section [AdvEvent] \u00b6 AECount=# Number of events you plan to have.

The newwer version of AECustom now adds the three AECustomX entries but sets them as blank.) Each AECustomX entry, if defined, must have a corresponding script entry. For example, by defining AECustom1=greater bloodmoon healing in the AdvEvent section, you would need a corresponding script defined that might read something like: [Script-AECustomEvent1] Commands=1 C1=/bc cast stun AEGem[x]=source Designate what the source of the spell is.

Cures *can* always be interrupted by any heal spell, unless you're using a cure spell that's already listed in your heal section (e.g. Cleric's \"Word of XXX\" line of spells may or may not interrupt for heals depending on where they are in your heal section). Modcure.inc will cast once per loop and then return to the main loop, so setting group cures (like Radiant Cure) toward the top would be best Be specific on cure types to avoid recasting the same cure over and over if it won't cure you.

AQAnnounce[x]=channel Channel to announce in, or leave blank for no announce. See ACAnnounce description in the AdvMelee section for further explanation. Annoucements also support formatting (makes it a bit easier to see in the MQ window). For example: ABAnnounce1=/bc [+r+]Cured +x+ \\<\\< +y+ %t +x+ >> with +g+ %s [+x+] '''AQSpellCntr[x]= Currently not used for anything, so don't worry about it :) AdvPull Section [AdvPull] \u00b6 This section is under development. APCheckTime=# Time (in seconds) to wait in between AdvPull executions. Default is 0. APRadius=# The distance around your target to check for more mobs as defined by APMobMax (basically, a check for adds). Default is 40. * APMobMax=# * The max amount of mobs (target + adds) you will allow before pulling. Default is 1. If there are less than APMobMax mobs within APRadius of your target, it will pull the mob. * APScript= Scriptname * Name of script to define how you want to tag the mob (throw stone, ranged, item clicky, spell, etc) and executes when you have a mob targeted to pull. The script name must have at least 3 characters. Default is empty. **YOU MUST CREATE A SCRIPT TO TAG THE MOB!** Modbot Scripts APPath= Pathname The name of the path to run for pulling/movement, as defined in your MBWayPnt.ini (See ModMove for more details on creating a path). The path name must be at least 3 characters. Default is empty. * APRetPath= ReturnPathname * The name of the path to use to move back to camp. The path must be defined in your MBWayPnt.ini file. The path name must be at least 3 characters. Default is empty. Mostly used for when the path back to camp is a different one than used to pull mobs (ie, you go through a one-way wall to pull or intentionally fall off a ledge and have to run the long way back). If you want to return the same way you came, you can just use WPLoop=TRUE in MBWayPnt.ini instead of having to set up a second path. * APBefore= * Command or series of commands (with multiline) to execute before the rest of AdvPull section. Must be at least 3 characters. Default is empty. * APAfter= * Command or series of commands (with multiline) to execute after AdvPull has finished. Default is empty. * APAnnounce= * A way to announce what you have pulled. Default is empty. * Note: This is not just a chat channel, but a place to put a full incoming message, ie: * APAnnounce=/gsay Incoming -[ %t ]- * APRetries=1 * Number of times to attempt to pull a mob in case it fails the first try (line of site, etc). This will strafe left and right on subsequent attempts. Default is 1. MBCommon.inc Settings \u00b6 The location and name of MBCommon.inc can now be set by changing line 38 in Modbot.mac. /declare MBCommon string outer MBCommon.ini It defaults to the ./macros folder, but the line can be changed to any path. Settings Section \u00b6 LoadAlias [1,0] This is an on / off setting to load the \"/alias /mb /echo MB-\" alias for commands. It is set to 0 after first run when alias should be loaded, but you can set to 1 to add it back to your Macroquest.ini file if it gets deleted. IniLocation Path to your MB_.ini files. Must end in / or if changed from default. LootIni [Loot.ini] This setting can be used to change the location of your Loot.ini file as well as the name. MBWayPntLocation [MBWayPnt.ini] This setting can be used to change the location of your MBWayPnt.ini file as well as the name of the file. CheckTargetDebuffs [TRUE|FALSE] This setting toggles on/off the ${Target.Buff} checking for debuffs (essentially this checks if the spell \"Stacks\" before casting.) Each debuff listed in MBCommon.ini now has an 'OverwritesID=' entry. This entry is meant for a list of debuffs that the spell doesn't 'Stack' with, but you want the debuff to overwrite. Spell Section \u00b6 Zone.ShortName - List of mobs excluded for that zone in a pipe -\"|\" delimited string. This setting is not present for any zones which you have nothing excluded. Immune lists for each spell are saved in their own section along with a MaxLevel=[100] setting. Change to the max level of the spell. As the macro finds mobs that are immune to the spell, the zone shortname is added to the entry as a variable along with the mob names in pipe delimited format. Mobs that are marked immune to debuffs can be marked in MBCommon.ini with an asterisk to allow for some names that have only some immune, and some not. For example, Dreadspire has some body types with same names where some are immune to mez, and some not (e.g. an aid to the Seneschal - some body types with that mob name are immune to befuddle, and others aren't). By adding an asterisk to the end of the name in the exclude section, the macro will repeat attempts to mez, etc. that mob type (rather than just marking them immune and not casting at all): _DreadspireImmune=|an aid to the Seneschal_|* The ADIfSpellImmune script, if defined, will only run if the mob is found to be immune after cast, but the astrik will not be replaced, and the spell will only cast once allowing the spell to still attempt on the next mob it hasn't been cast on. Overwrites= list of debuffs that the spell doesn't 'Stack' with, but you want the debuff to overwrite. This does require user intervention, and there's no way to set it auto-set them. MaxLevel= maximum level of mob that can be affected by debuff An entry in the spell section might look something like this: [Mystify] MaxLevel=83 thalassius_bImmune=|a sea mephit defender||a sea mephit evoker| OverwritesID=|14569|14570|14530| ModBot Class INI Examples \u00b6 ModBot`` ``Class`` ``INI`` ``Examples`` ``linked`` ``to`` ``another`` ``page ModBot`` ``v4`` ``Class`` ``INI`` ``Examples`` ``linked`` ``to`` ``another`` ``page Scripts and ModBot Variable Usage \u00b6 ModBot allows VERY customizable sripts to such an extent you can actually program your own sub-procedures within your INI file. You can harness ANY global variable within ModBot to use with the scripts. Scripts match MQ2 code to every extent, below are several examples of scripts and common variables one would use to create complex scripts Understanding scripts, syntax, example, how to \u00b6 Scripts General Info Scripts can be difficult and there are some MQ2 commands that give scripts trouble. Keep this in mind and prepare to post you script code should you have problems. No script can take more then 15 seconds to complete, however this can be modified in the code directly in the Sub MBScript or even changed in the script you create ({Timer} is the var) Scripts are executed from top to bottom and you are allowed to use a label :Top (e.g. /goto :Top), in your script. The /goto :Top option allows for complex loops to take place directly from code in the INI file If you use ANY INI generated ModBot global string variables that have spaces in your custom scripts they MUST be encapsulated by 2 apostrophies when used in the script, see PetCast example below. * Reserved Characters :*These characters can not be used in scripts ::*$ \" :*'' Two apostrophies are for passing variables with spaces in script code. Use them to replace quotes. Syntax [Script-] Commands= C1= . Cn= What does a script look like in your INI file: [Script-HelloWorld] Commands=2 C1=/echo Hello World C2=/if ({Timer}>50) /varset Timer 5s C3=/goto :Top In the example above it will echo to the MQ2ChatWindow \"Hello World\" for 5s. Notice how I do NOT use a $ to reference the \"Timer\" variable. How To use or launch a script :*/bc bob script HelloWorld :*You can set XXGem1=script and XXSpell=HelloWorld as a spell name for any of the spells you've configured in ModBot, and it will be triggered when that event, heal, etc would take place. Please see the below examples for complex script code.

There are actually three things that work together to make certain that your bots fight and return to a certain area - MQ2MoveUtils, MQ2Melee and the MB_charname.ini file (from ModBot). /makecamp x x x This is a MQ2MoveUtils setting that needs to be properly configured. For example: /makecamp radius x leash=on (or something like that) Please see the MQ2MoveUtils (PMS version) [ http://www.macroquest.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=31&t=15909 thread ] and MQ2MoveUtils:v11 for more detailed information. * /melee x x x * This is an MQ2Melee setting.

From inside EQ, type /macro modbot (e.g. /macro modbot OR /macro modbot raidmode). This will build, if it doesn't exist, your MB_.ini file. Optional entries will make a MB__.ini. Being shrouded on startup without using an option will use your race and class for the creation of an MB__.ini file. From inside EQ, end the macro by typing /endmac Tab out of EQ, locate your new MB_.ini file in your macro directory, and open it. You can use the editor of your choice, but Notepad will work just fine. For every component of the macro you want to use, increase the respective \"count\", if you want two heals, set AHCount=2, if you want 2 debuffs, set ADCount=2, etc. After you have set your counts, save and close the INI file. Tab back over into EQ and restart the macro (/macro modbot). This will now populate your INI file based on the count entries that you made in the previous step End the macro again by typing /endmac Open the INI file once more and \"tweak\" the newly created entries to fit your needs. When you are done, save and close the INI file. Tab back over to EQ and restart the macro. Your bot should now be just that, a BOT and will listen to your every command (assuming you are the master).

You must restart the ModBot macro after executing the addbuff command in order to complete the adding of the buff entry. The Spellname, etc. section can be entered directly (e.g. */mb addbuff \"Bone Mask of the Ancient Iksar|item\" iksar self_) or, if adding a clicky, by holding the item on your cursor (e.g._ /mb addbuff \"${Cursor.Name}|item\" iksar self*). Please note that the quotes around the spellname|gem section are required. ABTarType will accept multiple targets if quotes are used (e.g. */mb addbuff \"Levitiation|gem1\" levi \"war mnk rog\"*). addbuff execution will add ABGem, ABSpell, ABSpellAlias and ABTarType entries to the characters INI file. The remaining buff lines (ABSpellFociX, ABDurModX, etc.) will be added once you restart the ModBot macro (the array size change (ABCount) will also not increment until after re-start). For example, using these Bonemask example command, the following entires will be added to the INI file (where \"X\" is equal to whatever the next numbered entry is in your advbuff section): ABGemX=item ABSpellX=Bone Mask of the Ancient Iksar ABSpellAliasX=iksar ABTarTypeX=self attack (Sets DoMelee TRUE and forces bot to attack the TankName's target) attack (Sets DoMelee TRUE and forces bot to attack the target) * Note: OffTank must be TRUE to use this option (I may remove this requirement though TBD) * Example 1 - /bc attack badguy * Example 2 = /bc attack badguy 100 20 buffup (This will set DoBuffs & DoEvents TRUE & DoHeals FALSE) campout (Performs a /camp desktop and ends the macro) cast <on/off> (This will disable or enable the spell associated with this alias) cast [<spawnname/id> \\<%t> ] [<spawnname/id> \\<%t> ] (infinte) If the spell is detrimental, CAST targets the requester's target. If the spell is beneficial, it targets the sender or, if grp is present, it casts buff on group members. If %t is present, it targets the requester's target. The cast command will ignore INI settings for things like minmana, maxmana, recasts, buff debuff counters, etc. This command is mainly used for manual, \"one off\" type casts.

Example: /t buffhp dobuffs [on, true, off, false, ] docombines (Toggle that turns docombines on/off (default off). Docombines will check for an open tradeskill window with an enabled combine button (you have to select recipe), and will click the button.

For example, while holding an item on cursor, */mb doquest 4 Hair of the Dog* will set the item you're holding to \"=Quest|4|Hair of the Dog|\" in loot.ini. Can also be used in conjunction with the QuestOnly variable (found in the setting section of the loot.ini file). If both doquest and QuestOnly are set to TRUE, your toon will only loot quest items.

If you want to force an exclude you must edit the INI file and place a \"#\" in front of the mobs name (e.g. ExcludeList=a dusty barrel|a dark coffin|#a bitten victim|a hollow tree|, this will always force \"a bitten victim\" to be on the exclude list) Use the following commands from a character to add mobs to the exclude list (Kroak suggested just tossing this in a two-line hotkey): /bcaa //mb exclude ${Target.CleanName} Will write the exclusion to a string that is checked through the debuff loop /bcaa //mb exclude save Will write the exclusion in the mbcommon.ini and that exclusion includes the zone id, so mobs of the same name in a different zone are NOT excluded. You shouldn't have to re-run the macro after an exclude but if you do this in the midst of comabat or something, while mobs are near, it may not \"take\" as quickly. For mob names with spaces in them, simply enter the name without any quotations. For example: ''/bcaa //mb exclude a small bat See the Include command (found below) to temporarily remove a mob from the alert list follow (Follows the sender or ) follow close (Follows the sender within 3 steps, very close) give (Calls the sub GiveCheck to hand an item to a toon or NPC.)

Setting the ADTarBegHP at least over the level of all other functions at least attempts to keep the slow first. Also.. I find the macro works best if you always set your ACManaPct very low.

Please note that idle is only used in ABTarType when cbt is also used. aura used to cast an aura - must be used with self (e.g. ABTarType1=self aura) Note that Bard auras *REQUIRE* ABSpellAlias to be set up to cast, and modbuff will use CastCall to actually cast the aura. * tank used to cast only on the designated group tank.

For the most part this shouldn't be needed for rebuffing if all of your toons are NetBots members.

In fact, you could use any one of the four spell icons/names that Unity creates). Please note that if the name you have in ABSpellIcon doesn't evaluate to a spell name, the buff will be skipped.

By adding an asterisk to the end of the name in the exclude section, the macro will repeat attempts to mez, etc. that mob type (rather than just marking them immune and not casting at all): _DreadspireImmune=|an aid to the Seneschal_|* The ADIfSpellImmune script, if defined, will only run if the mob is found to be immune after cast, but the astrik will not be replaced, and the spell will only cast once allowing the spell to still attempt on the next mob it hasn't been cast on. Overwrites= list of debuffs that the spell doesn't 'Stack' with, but you want the debuff to overwrite. This does require user intervention, and there's no way to set it auto-set them. MaxLevel= maximum level of mob that can be affected by debuff An entry in the spell section might look something like this: [Mystify] MaxLevel=83 thalassius_bImmune=|a sea mephit defender||a sea mephit evoker| OverwritesID=|14569|14570|14530|","title":"Spell Section"},{"location":"macros/gallery/modbot/#modbot-class-ini-examples","text":"ModBot`` ``Class`` ``INI`` ``Examples`` ``linked`` ``to`` ``another`` ``page ModBot`` ``v4`` ``Class`` ``INI`` ``Examples`` ``linked`` ``to`` ``another`` ``page","title":"ModBot Class INI Examples"},{"location":"macros/gallery/modbot/#scripts-and-modbot-variable-usage","text":"ModBot allows VERY customizable sripts to such an extent you can actually program your own sub-procedures within your INI file.

The orignial AAPurchase thread can be found Here . AAPurchase will do the following: Purchase AA's based on an array created from an ini file (this file is auto-created for you with the AAPurchase implementation in ModBot). Allow you to specify how many levels of a skill to purchase. Skip any AA that you are too low to purchase at your level. Inform you that it was not able to purchase the skill yet and tell you how much you have and how much it costs. Inform you of the skill it purchased and how much it cost. Inform you that you were not able to purchase a skill yet and what level is requires. Inform you when a skill you have defined is maxed, and will skip to the next in the list. Inform you to define new AA's you when all current defined AA's are maxed. Detect if you do not have Fast AA Purchase on and confirm you want to purchase the AA. Allow you to define your own ini section so that you can add shroud abilities to purchase without losing your characters list to purchase (more on this in a later wiki update). Warn you when you have 27+ AA's banked. Switch you to 100% level XP when ou reach 30 banked AA's How to use: An AA_CharName.ini should automatically be created for you in your \\Macros folder (using functionality created by spudman). The general layout of that file is: [AAtoBuy] AACount=[Number of AAs in the ini list] AA1=|#|M|S the name of the AA (e.g. Combat Stability) # the maximum level of this AA to purchase (do not use in combination with the 'M' parameter) M indicates that you want to purchase this AA to its maximum level possible S indicates that you want to skip purchasing this AA (if you don't hae enough AA points saved) and check the next AA Example: [AAtoBuy] AACount=4 AA1=Combat Agility|2 AA2=Combat Stability|M AA3=Fury of Magic|M|S AA4=Teleport Bind|M AA1 would be the first AA you want to train. AA2 would be the second. Add more to your hearts content. There is no max limit, but it will take longer to run, especially if you do not clean up the list removing those you have already maxed. AA1 (Combat Agility) would purchase until it reached level 2 (of 28 possible) and then skip to the next AA to purchase in the list. The 'M' parameter for AA2 would tell it to purchase Combat Stability to the max ability level. AAPurchase will continue to save AAs and purchase levels until you have maxed out what you can buy of this AA. Only then will it move on to checking AAs further down the list. The 'M|S' parameters for AA3 would tell it to purchase Fury of Magic to its max level. If you don't have enough AA points to purchase the next level of Fury of Magic, the 'S' parameter would cause it to skip to the next AA to buy (Teleport Bind) and purchase that instead (assuming you have enough AA points saved for that). Additional Info: Change this to change which channel you send your notifications to (e.g. /bc , /echo , /mqlog): #define def_channel_ /echo From fearless: If you want to know who is training what when using /mqlog use this Code: #define def_channel_ \"/mqlog $[Me.Name}\" If you want to see what your bots are up to (and you have Netbots loaded...), use the following command: /echo ${NetBots[CharName].PctAAExp} (there's also a TypeMember(PctExp); in the plugin. Depending on the Netbots version you have there's also TotalAA, UsedAA, and UnusedAA.) Return to main ModBot Wiki Forage \u00b6 Note: More information needed for this section - feel free to add!! -1 means keep all no matter how many you have. 0 is destroy. Any positive number is how many to keep. Modloot \u00b6 Modloot was originally based on Forking's Loot.inc (original thread can be found here ), but several sections have had complete rewrites and no longer even resemble the original (though they have been made to be backwards compatible for the older options). The creation of the initial Loot.ini file (found in the \\Macros folder) is triggered by setting 'DoLoot=TRUE' in your MB_CharName.ini file. The location of the Loot.ini file (as well as its name) can be changed using the 'Loot.ini=' section in MBCommon.ini. While looting is enabled (DoLoot=TRUE), your bot will automatically attempt to loot whenever there are corpses within CorpseRadius and no mobs within the MobsTooClose radius. Once activated, looting will start up with some default actions: The first time an item is found, it will be added to the Loot.ini file under it's associated alphabetical section. Depending on the item's particular flag type, it will be set to either Keep or Ignore: Nodrop items are set to Ignore (item will be left on corpse). Quest flag items are set to Ignore (item will be left on corpse). Most other items are set to Keep (item will be looted). The resulting Loot.ini file can be customized to loot and dispose of items in a more efficient manner (rather than just keeping or ignoring something). The basic format of the modloot 'Loot.ini' file is as follows: Settings Section - [Settings] \u00b6 LootMobs =[TRUE,FALSE] (set by DoLoot in MB_CharName.ini) CorpseRadius =[Radius #] (The default radius within which to search for corpses to loot. Default to 100.) MobsTooClose =[Radius #] (The default radius within which it will watch for other mobs before looting (prevents looting when there are still mobs in camp). Default to 50.) CorpseRotTime =[Corpse rot time in seconds] (The time before corpses rot. Default 440s.) ?? ReportLoot =[TRUE,FALSE] (Report \\(or not\\) looting activities to the defined LootChannel) LootChannel =[desired loot channel] (Channel on which looting actions will be announced (e.g. \"bc\") Category =[cat1,cat2,etc.] (Used to specify loot categories. Each argument added to 'Category' will add a variable to modbot. For example, 'Category=Smithing,Tailoring' would result in two new entries in the loot.ini file on the next run of modbot: Category=Smithing,Tailoring Smithing= Tailoring= If desired, the new entries can then be modified to define which toons can loot which types of items. ${NetBots.Client} will make sure all toons will loot the item if the category is only to be used with other commands. Please note that you are not required to define toon names for this (thus allowing a single looter to loot all items): Category=Smithing,Tailoring Smithing=ToonName1,ToonName2 Tailoring=ToonName1 After the Category entires have been defined, items can be marked in the Items section as belonging to a particular category: Rhenium Ore=Smithing Categories can also be used with other commands. For instance: /mb getbank Smithing TRUE \\<-- will search your bank for all items marked 'Smithing' and place them on your toon until you run out of room. The True|False option is Stacks or Singles. /mb give Smithing TRUE # \\<-- will give # of Stacks (TRUE|FALSE) of Smithing items to . KeepScript =[ScriptName] (Allows you to define a full script that can be used to add extra options or checks before looting. You can now also set item names as =Script in your loot.ini file to use this option. Please note that the script will also run for all items marked 'Sell' to allow for checking values. If your script decides to loot the item, you will need to call the appropriate sub from your script. For example (this was meant only to run for 'Sell' option, but can be expanded.): [Script-ValueCheck] Commands=1 C1=/if (!{Corpse.Item[{Param1}].Value} || {Corpse.Item[{Param1}].Value} && {Corpse.Item[{Param1}].Value}>1000) /call LootItem {Param1} Keep Right A '/call LootItem {Param1} Destroy Left' will destroy the item. Doing nothing, or exiting the script will result in item left on corpse QuestOnly =[TRUE,FALSE] (Defaults to FALSE. To be used with DoQuest so the toon will only loot quest items. If this is true and doquest is false, the bot will only loot cash off mob.) Items Section - [] \u00b6 =[|||] (Tells modloot what to do with the item.) can equal Keep, Destroy, Ignore, Quest or CategoryName. Please note that | cannot be used at the same time as ToonName and/or Category. Raw Diamond=ToonName \\<-- Only ToonName will loot Raw Diamonds (can be used in conjunction with Keep and Quantity). Raw Diamond=Keep \\<-- Keeps all Raw Diamonds Raw Diamond=Keep|10 \\<-- Keeps Raw Diamonds until you have 10 of them. After that it leaves them on the corpse.

The orignial AAPurchase thread can be found Here . AAPurchase will do the following: Purchase AA's based on an array created from an ini file (this file is auto-created for you with the AAPurchase implementation in ModBot). Allow you to specify how many levels of a skill to purchase. Skip any AA that you are too low to purchase at your level. Inform you that it was not able to purchase the skill yet and tell you how much you have and how much it costs. Inform you of the skill it purchased and how much it cost. Inform you that you were not able to purchase a skill yet and what level is requires. Inform you when a skill you have defined is maxed, and will skip to the next in the list. Inform you to define new AA's you when all current defined AA's are maxed. Detect if you do not have Fast AA Purchase on and confirm you want to purchase the AA. Allow you to define your own ini section so that you can add shroud abilities to purchase without losing your characters list to purchase (more on this in a later wiki update). Warn you when you have 27+ AA's banked. Switch you to 100% level XP when ou reach 30 banked AA's How to use: An AA_CharName.ini should automatically be created for you in your \\Macros folder (using functionality created by spudman). The general layout of that file is: [AAtoBuy] AACount=[Number of AAs in the ini list] AA1=|#|M|S the name of the AA (e.g. Combat Stability) # the maximum level of this AA to purchase (do not use in combination with the 'M' parameter) M indicates that you want to purchase this AA to its maximum level possible S indicates that you want to skip purchasing this AA (if you don't hae enough AA points saved) and check the next AA Example: [AAtoBuy] AACount=4 AA1=Combat Agility|2 AA2=Combat Stability|M AA3=Fury of Magic|M|S AA4=Teleport Bind|M AA1 would be the first AA you want to train. AA2 would be the second. Add more to your hearts content. There is no max limit, but it will take longer to run, especially if you do not clean up the list removing those you have already maxed. AA1 (Combat Agility) would purchase until it reached level 2 (of 28 possible) and then skip to the next AA to purchase in the list. The 'M' parameter for AA2 would tell it to purchase Combat Stability to the max ability level. AAPurchase will continue to save AAs and purchase levels until you have maxed out what you can buy of this AA. Only then will it move on to checking AAs further down the list. The 'M|S' parameters for AA3 would tell it to purchase Fury of Magic to its max level. If you don't have enough AA points to purchase the next level of Fury of Magic, the 'S' parameter would cause it to skip to the next AA to buy (Teleport Bind) and purchase that instead (assuming you have enough AA points saved for that). Additional Info: Change this to change which channel you send your notifications to (e.g. /bc , /echo , /mqlog): #define def_channel_ /echo From fearless: If you want to know who is training what when using /mqlog use this Code: #define def_channel_ \"/mqlog $[Me.Name}\" If you want to see what your bots are up to (and you have Netbots loaded...), use the following command: /echo ${NetBots[CharName].PctAAExp} (there's also a TypeMember(PctExp); in the plugin.

The creation of the initial Loot.ini file (found in the \\Macros folder) is triggered by setting 'DoLoot=TRUE' in your MB_CharName.ini file. The location of the Loot.ini file (as well as its name) can be changed using the 'Loot.ini=' section in MBCommon.ini. While looting is enabled (DoLoot=TRUE), your bot will automatically attempt to loot whenever there are corpses within CorpseRadius and no mobs within the MobsTooClose radius. Once activated, looting will start up with some default actions: The first time an item is found, it will be added to the Loot.ini file under it's associated alphabetical section. Depending on the item's particular flag type, it will be set to either Keep or Ignore: Nodrop items are set to Ignore (item will be left on corpse). Quest flag items are set to Ignore (item will be left on corpse). Most other items are set to Keep (item will be looted). The resulting Loot.ini file can be customized to loot and dispose of items in a more efficient manner (rather than just keeping or ignoring something).

Please note that you are not required to define toon names for this (thus allowing a single looter to loot all items): Category=Smithing,Tailoring Smithing=ToonName1,ToonName2 Tailoring=ToonName1 After the Category entires have been defined, items can be marked in the Items section as belonging to a particular category: Rhenium Ore=Smithing Categories can also be used with other commands.

The format for each command is shown below: COMMAND Syntax: /COMMAND <parameters>|<or other parameters> [<optional parameter>] LITERAL Description: Command description... Examples: Example usages... Within the syntax descriptions, a vertical line (or pipe) -- \"|\" indicates an either/or choice. Any parameters enclosed within \\< > symbols indicates a user-supplied value. Any parameters enclosed in [ ] symbols is optional. Any parameter information not enclosed within \\< > should be considered a literal expression (that is you enter THAT text, commonly this is the word \"ON\" or \"OFF\" in conjunction with various commands). Command List: \u00b6 The following is a list of RH commands: ADDMASTER Syntax: /addmaster <name> Description: This command adds a \"master\" (an authorized remote controller) given the supplied name to the master control list stored within the RHSettings.INI file. Whenever a \"master\" sends a tell to the rogue running RH, and the tell starts with a \"/\" character, RH will execute the entire line of the tell. A maximum of 20 masters can be stored; after the 20 th master is stored, you'll be forced to delete one before you can add another. Examples: Add a master named Hootey: /addmaster Hootey Send a tell (as the master) to the rogue named Pokey, having the rogue target Mary and hug her and kiss her: /tell pokey /multiline ; /target Mary ; /hug ; /kiss Send a tell (as the master) to the rogue named Dokey, having the rogue camp: /tell dokey /camp AUTOASSIST Syntax: /autoassist ON|OFF|<main assist> [<%health>] Description: Allows you to activate or deactivate automatically assisting a PC or NPC, as well as setting the name of the PC or NPC you wish to assist. The \"% health\" parameter is a value from 1 to 99 designating the percentage health that your target must reach before you engage. The percentage health is an optional parameter that defaults to 98% Examples: Assist someone named \"Mywarriorfriend\" when his (and your) target has 97% health or less: /autoassist Mywarriorfriend 97 Turn autoassisting on and off respectively: /autoassist on /autoassist off AUTOCHICKEN Syntax: /autochicken ON|OFF|<nimble%> [ESCAPE] Description: Provides you with automatic self-preservation. When activated, RH will execute the nimble discipline (if you have it) whenever your health percentage reaches the \"nimble%\" parameter. If the word \"Escape\" is optionally supplied, if nimble is unavailable (due to being blown or not purchased), this feature will cease combat and use your escape AA skill. Examples: Activate autochicken and try to use nimble if your health is at 20% or lower and escape if nimble used/blown: /autochicken 20 escape Turn autochicken on with default (previous) values or turn it off, respectively: /autochicken on /autochicken off AUTODISC1 Syntax: /autodisc1 ON|OFF|<\"discipline name\"> <end%> <reuse> Description: Establish an optional discipline to employ while fighting. The specified discipline (enclosed within \" \" if it's more than one word!) will be executed any time you have at least \"end%\" amount of endurance. You must also specify the reuse time of the discipline (minutes) as this information is currently unknown to MQ2 for the original combat disciplines. Examples: Turn discipline #1 on, set it to employ the duelist discipline if it's ready and you have at least 40 endurance (and specify that the re-use time on duelist is 30 minutes): /autodisc1 Duelist 40 30 Turn discipline #1 on, set it to employ the deadly precision discipline if it's ready and you have at least 60 endurance (and specify that the re-use time on deadly precision is 5 minutes): /autodisc1 \"Deadly Precision\" 60 5 Turn off the disc1, but retain settings: /autodisc1 off Reactivate disc1 using existing settings: /autodisc1 on AUTODISC2 Syntax: /autodisc2 ON|OFF|<\"discipline name\"> <end%> <reuse> Description: Establish an optional discipline to employ while fighting. The specified discipline (enclosed within \" \" if it's more than one word!) will be executed any time you have at least \"end%\" amount of endurance. You must also specify the reuse time of the discipline (minutes) as this information is currently unknown to MQ2 for the original combat disciplines. Examples: Turn discipline #2 on, set it to employ the duelist discipline if it's ready and you have at least 40 endurance (and specify that the re-use time on duelist is 30 minutes): /autodisc2 Duelist 40 30 Turn discipline #2 on, set it to employ the deadly precision discipline if it's ready and you have at least 60 endurance (and specify that the re-use time on deadly precision is 5 minutes): /autodisc2 \"Deadly Precision\" 60 5 Turn off the disc, but retain settings: /autodisc2 off Reactivate disc using existing settings: /autodisc2 on AUTOEVADE Syntax: /autoevade Description: Toggles automatic evade abilities while fighting on or off. If on, they'll be turned off (and vice versa). Examples: N/A AUTOFOLLOW Syntax: /autofollow [<name>] [<distance>] Description: This command will activate autofollowing, which will stay active until your target changes (to nothing, yourself, or anything else). If an RH event is detected \\(such as a situation where autoassist is warranted, or looting, for example\\) autofollow will be deactivated automatically and the interrupting activity will take place. You need not specify range or target (it will use the current target if one isn't specified). Examples: Activate autofollow on Chichihooah and stay within 20 feet of her: /autofollow chichihooah 20 AUTOHS Syntax: /autohs Description: Toggles automatic hide and sneak abilities while not fighting on or off. If on, they'll be turned off (and vice versa). Examples: N/A AUTONINJA Syntax: /autoninja OFF|DROP|DROPABLE|ALL [<range>] Description: This command will activate automatic NPC corpse looting whenever you are awarded experience. The first parameter can be set to ALL (which will loot everything on a corpse), DROP or DROPABLE \\(which will only loot non-NODROP flagged items\\) , or OFF \\(which disables corpse looting\\) . The optional range parameter determines how far away RH will \"look\" for a corpse from your position at time of experience award (default is 50 feet). Examples: Turn on ninjalooting and get everything that drops (use default range): /autoninja all Turn on ninjalooting and get only tradable items; only seek corpses no farther than 20 feet away: /autoninja drop 20 Turn off ninjalooting: /autoninja off AUTOPICK Syntax: /autopick Description: Toggles automatic pickpocketing abilities while fighting on or off. If on, they'll be turned off (and vice versa). Examples: N/A AUTOSTICK Syntax: /autostick Description: Toggles automatic sticking to targets while fighting them. Autosticking implies staying behind the target as well, unless obstructed by an object preventing you from getting behind it or while tanking. Do not confuse /autoassist and /autostick--these are mutually exclusive features that may be used independently of each other. Examples: N/A AUTOTRAPS Syntax: /autotraps Description: Toggles automatic trap negotiation while not in combat. This feature will look for both box and floor traps, and disarm them when it finds one. If the feature is on, it will be turned off (and vice versa). Examples: N/A CHANNEL Syntax: /channel <channel> Description: With this command, you can control where RH directs it's output. Status information and general RH operations text will go to whatever channel you set. In essence, whatever text you supply here is suffixed after a \"/\" and then output strings are appended afterwards. \"Echo\" is the default channel. Creative users can use the IRC plugin and set the channel to \"I\" to send RH output to an existing IRC channel. Examples: Redirect RH output to chat channel 1: /channel 1 Redirect RH output to an irc channel (assuming you've loaded the MQ2IRC plugin and already joined a channel): /channel i Restore RH output to the MQ2 window (echo channel): /channel echo CLOSENESS Syntax: /closeness <%hitrange> Description: With this command you can set the percentage of the maximum range used in order to reach your target while autosticking. For some zones (Kael for example) the reported range is incorrect and too large--for such zones, set the closeness range to a smaller value such as 20 or 30. For most zones, 70% is adequate. Examples: Set the closeness value to 30%: /closeness 30 DRAG Syntax: /drag <body1> <body2> ... <bodyN> Description: Drag corpses. You must supply one or more player names as parameters (unlimited). In order to stop dragging bodies, target yourself (F1). Examples: Drag your friends Booger and Chooger: /drag booger chooger DYNAGGRO Syntax: /dynaggro Description: Toggles whether or not RH should be responsible for the your rogue's aggression level (only meaningful if you're using /autoassist). This feature will LOWER the percentage at which autoassist will fire by 1% if you were attacked during any given fight. If you were not attacked on the most recent fight, it will RAISE the percentage at which autoassist will fire by 1%. The assist percentage never stabilizes--it will always either go up or down after every fight. When using this command, if the feature is on, it will be turned off (and vice versa). Examples: N/A DYNCLOSE Syntax: /dynclose Description: Toggles whether or not RH should be responsible for the temporary automatic adjustment of the closeness to target (requires /autostick to be on). This feature will move you 20% closer to the target every two seconds, until you're in swinging range. Original closeness value is restored when the current target is killed. When using this command, if the feature is on, it will be turned off (and vice versa). Examples: N/A ENDFLOOR Syntax: /endfloor <%endurance> Description: With this command you can set the percentage of your endurance that is required in order for you to continue to initiate a fight with the strike discipline. When your endurance drops below this percentage value, you'll only autoattack when starting a fight. Examples: Set the strike endurance floor to 75%: /endfloor 75 IBOUNCE Syntax: /ibounce <itemalias> <\"Spell Name\"&#62; Description: This command is part of a set of three commands used to manage clickable items and their effects. This particular command allows you to set and store which spell effects do not stack with the spell effect created by a given clickable item. You may store an unlimited number of spell effects that \"bounce off\" of a given clickable item's effect. When RH maintains your clickable buffs, it will consult your existing buffs looking for these bounce spells prior to trying to re-click the conflicting item. Enclose spell names in double quotes (\" \")! The item in question must be aliased with the /iset command prior to using this command. Examples: Set two bounce effects for an item aliased as simply \"ring\" (perhaps a Coldain's Hero Ring), particularly Shield of Spikes and Shield of Thorns: /ibounce ring \"Shield of Spikes\" /ibounce ring \"Shield of Thorns\" ICLICK Syntax: /iclick <itemalias> Description: This command is part of a set of three commands used to manage clickable items and their effects. This particular command allows you to request RH to invoke the clickable effect for a given item. If you're not wearing the item, RH will fetch it, click it, put it back in it's original container (in it's original spot) and close the container. The item in question must be aliased with the /iset command prior to using this command. Examples: Have RH fetch the item aliased as \"ring\" (perhaps a Coldain's Hero Ring), and click it to invoke it's effect: /iclick ring ISET Syntax: /iset <itemalias> KEEPUP|NOKEEPUP <\"Item Name\"> Description: This command is part of a set of three commands used to manage clickable items and their effects. This particular command allows you to set and store an item alias for a given clickable item. You also can specify whether or not you want RH to automatically try to maintain the spell effect of this item. If a superior spell effect doesn't stack with the item's effect, you should use the /ibounce command to specify said spells. Examples: Have RH alias \"ring\" for your Coldain's Hero Ring, and also indicate you wish RH to maintain the Shield of the Eighth, if possible: /iset ring keepup \"Coldain Hero's Insignia Ring\" LEASH Syntax: /leash OFF|<distance> <master> Description: With the leash command, you can dynamically create one of two types of leashes and tether yourself to it: a stake-bound leash or a master-bound leash. If you specify just a distance and no master, /leash will drive a \"stake\" in the ground at your current position, and return to this point after you finish a combat. If you specify both distance and a master, after combats you'll return to the \"master's\" side, regardless of where the master is located. If you indicate OFF as a parameter instead of a distance, leashing will be turned off. Examples: Create a 200 foot leash that is attached to a virtual stake: /leash 200 Create a 250 foot leash that is attached to your warrior buddy named Booger: /leash 250 booger Turn all leashing off: /leash off LEASHFLEX Syntax: /leashflex <%length> Description: With this command you can set the threshold of when RH considers you to be \"close enough\" to the stake or master to stop moving toward it. If you set the leash flexibility very low (1), you'll return to the leash and nearly be on top of the stake or master. If you set the leash flexibility very high (100), you'll never return to the stake or master, but you won't go beyond your leash length when autosticking either. Examples: Set the leash flexibility to 50% of the leash's length: /leashflex 50 LOOTMYCORPSE Syntax: /lootmycorpse Description: With this command, you request RH to loot your entire corpse. Be warned that it's not aware of whether or not you've received a resurrection yet or not! If you're body is too far away or lag is too intense, it will abort with an appropriate failure message. Examples: N/A MAINASSIST Syntax: /mainassist <player> Description: This command is part of a set of three commands used to designate who you should autoassist, assuming you've activated the autoassist feature. This particular command sets the main assist (the main assist is also settable via /autoassist; however using autoassist both sets the main assist AND turns autoassist on--this command will only set the main assist). Examples: Make your buddy warrior \"Booger\" your main assist (but don't turn on autoassist): /mainassist booger PAUSE Syntax: /pause Description: The pause command suspends all of RH's operations. Use this if you want to temporarily disable RH without unloading it. Examples: N/A REMMASTER Syntax: /addmaster <name> Description: This command removes a \"master\" (an authorized remote controller) given the supplied name from the master control list stored within the RHSettings.INI file. It is a complimentary function to the ADDMASTER command. Examples: Remove the master named Hootey: /remmaster Hootey RHHELP Syntax: /rhhelp Description: This command will give you a very terse list of all of RH's commands and their abbreviated syntax. It is NO substitute for this manual! Examples: N/A SECONDASSIST Syntax: /secondassist <player> Description: This command is part of a set of three commands used to designate who you should autoassist, assuming you've activated the autoassist feature. This particular command sets the secondary assist. If the main assist dies, zones, or linkdies, RH will cascade to the secondary assist as a backup and will reinstate the main assist whenever they're alive or reconnect again. Examples: Make the dastardly shadowknight \"Drevil\" your secondary assist: /secondassist drevil STATUS Syntax: /status Description: The status command will show you the current state of all of RH's relevant functions (ON or OFF as TRUE or FALSE) as well as any user-defined values for those thresholds (endurance floors, stick distances, etc.) Examples: N/A STICKDIST Syntax: /stickdist <range_to_target> <range_to_tank> Description: With this command, you can regulate how close you must be to both your current target or the main assist in order to continue (or begin) autosticking to a given target. If you find yourself farther than the specified range to target or you've wandered farther than the specified range to your tank/mainassist, you will stop sticking to the target. This command is mostly useful to prevent you from chasing down runners when the main assist does not (or should not) as well as not running after mobs that recently gated far, far away. Examples: Set the maximum distance you'll pursue a mob at to 50 feet and the maximum \"wander\" distance from the tank to 100 feet: /stickdist 50 100 STOPFIGHT Syntax: /stopfight <%health> Description: With this command, you can control when RH turns off autoattack. Whenever your health reaches the specified percentage health parameter, RH will stop fighting. Examples: Cease combat when your health reaches 20% of it's maximum: /stopfight 20 STRIKEDISC Syntax: /strikedisc <strikeskill> Description: This command allows you to set your best available strike skill. The default skill is Assassin's Strike, but should you be lower level or been lucky enough to obtain later strike discipline books, this is the command you use to set the appropriate strike skill name. The name of the skill only has to be unique enough to differentiate it from other strike skills (i.e. ancient, kyv, or assassin are all fine). Examples: Set the strike skill to be used to \"Kyv's Strike\": /strikedisc kyv TARGETSWITCH Syntax: /targetswitch Description: Toggles whether or not RH should automatically choose a new target if the main assist does, or if it should \"finish off\" the current target. If your main assist is also the puller, you may want target switching OFF, as it will be expected that you finish off the last one before the next one is arrives. When using this command, if the feature is on, it will be turned off (and vice versa). Examples: N/A THIRDASSIST Syntax: /thirdassist <player> Description: This command is part of a set of three commands used to designate who you should autoassist, assuming you've activated the autoassist feature. This particular command sets the tertiary assist. If the main assist and secondary assist die, zone, or linkdie, RH will cascade to the tertiary assist as a backup's backup and will reinstate the main assist whenever they're alive or reconnect again. Examples: Make your friendly paladin \"Goodytwoshoes\" your tertiary assist: /thirdassist goodytwoshoes VERBOSITY Syntax: /verbosity 0|1|2 Description: With this command, you determine the level of text output that RH generates. A verbosity level of '0' will only output command switching information, but RH operational output will be almost completely silent. Verbosity level 1 shows all major RH activity. Verbosity level 2 shows everything, including ancillary RH background operations. The default is 2. Examples: Make RH almost completely mute: /verbosity 0 Have RH output all information possible: /verbosity 2 WEAPONSWITCH Syntax: /weaponswitch OFF|<weapon1> <\"switch text\"> <weapon2> Description: With this command, you can have RH automatically choose between two different weapons, depending on a settable situation. At the end of a combat, RH will restore weapon1 to your grasp. Whenever the supplied \"switch text\" is encountered (usually this the proc message, be it personal buff or target debuff) the weapon will be swapped out for weapon2 . WEAPONSWITCH is also smart enough to determine if the weapon procs a buff (in which case you'd probably like it to only switch back to weapon1 when the proc'ed buff wears off rather than after you finish off the mob. It handles this automatically. Make sure you do not typo the name of the weapons, or the switch text; also, the switch text does not need to be complete, but should be as complete as possible to not accidentally swap weapons around if someone speaks the trigger text. Weapons will be retrieved and deposited in any containers they come from (or on your character). Alternately, you can specify OFF as the first parameter to stop weaponswitching. Examples: Use Locustlure as your default weapon, but switch to the Horn of Hsagra if Locustlure procs: /weaponswitch Locustlure \"yawns.\" \"The Horn of Hsagra\" Use the Dart of Immobility as your default weapon, but switch to Ifir if your Dart procs: /weaponswitch \"Dart of Immobility\" \"screams as poison\" \"Ifir, Dagger of Fire\" Use a Primal Spear as your default weapon until you receive avatar, but switch to Ifir if your primal proc'ed and you still have avatar: /weaponswitch \"Primal Velium Spear\" \"Your body screams\" \"Ifir, Dagger of Fire\" Turn off weaponswitching: /weaponswitch OFF","title":"Rogue Helper Command List"},{"location":"macros/gallery/rogue-helper-command-list/#rogue-helper-command-list","text":"","title":"Rogue Helper Command List"},{"location":"macros/gallery/rogue-helper-command-list/#command-list-overview","text":"Presentation format for RH commands can be found in the section labeled \"Command List.\" Command names and parameters are capitalized for emphasis, but it should be noted that they are not case-sensitive.

The \"% health\" parameter is a value from 1 to 99 designating the percentage health that your target must reach before you engage. The percentage health is an optional parameter that defaults to 98% Examples: Assist someone named \"Mywarriorfriend\" when his (and your) target has 97% health or less: /autoassist Mywarriorfriend 97 Turn autoassisting on and off respectively: /autoassist on /autoassist off AUTOCHICKEN Syntax: /autochicken ON|OFF|<nimble%> [ESCAPE] Description: Provides you with automatic self-preservation. When activated, RH will execute the nimble discipline (if you have it) whenever your health percentage reaches the \"nimble%\" parameter. If the word \"Escape\" is optionally supplied, if nimble is unavailable (due to being blown or not purchased), this feature will cease combat and use your escape AA skill. Examples: Activate autochicken and try to use nimble if your health is at 20% or lower and escape if nimble used/blown: /autochicken 20 escape Turn autochicken on with default (previous) values or turn it off, respectively: /autochicken on /autochicken off AUTODISC1 Syntax: /autodisc1 ON|OFF|<\"discipline name\"> <end%> <reuse> Description: Establish an optional discipline to employ while fighting.

If on, they'll be turned off (and vice versa). Examples: N/A AUTOFOLLOW Syntax: /autofollow [<name>] [<distance>] Description: This command will activate autofollowing, which will stay active until your target changes (to nothing, yourself, or anything else). If an RH event is detected \\(such as a situation where autoassist is warranted, or looting, for example\\) autofollow will be deactivated automatically and the interrupting activity will take place. You need not specify range or target (it will use the current target if one isn't specified). Examples: Activate autofollow on Chichihooah and stay within 20 feet of her: /autofollow chichihooah 20 AUTOHS Syntax: /autohs Description: Toggles automatic hide and sneak abilities while not fighting on or off. If on, they'll be turned off (and vice versa). Examples: N/A AUTONINJA Syntax: /autoninja OFF|DROP|DROPABLE|ALL [<range>] Description: This command will activate automatic NPC corpse looting whenever you are awarded experience. The first parameter can be set to ALL (which will loot everything on a corpse), DROP or DROPABLE \\(which will only loot non-NODROP flagged items\\) , or OFF \\(which disables corpse looting\\) . The optional range parameter determines how far away RH will \"look\" for a corpse from your position at time of experience award (default is 50 feet). Examples: Turn on ninjalooting and get everything that drops (use default range): /autoninja all Turn on ninjalooting and get only tradable items; only seek corpses no farther than 20 feet away: /autoninja drop 20 Turn off ninjalooting: /autoninja off AUTOPICK Syntax: /autopick Description: Toggles automatic pickpocketing abilities while fighting on or off. If on, they'll be turned off (and vice versa). Examples: N/A AUTOSTICK Syntax: /autostick Description: Toggles automatic sticking to targets while fighting them. Autosticking implies staying behind the target as well, unless obstructed by an object preventing you from getting behind it or while tanking. Do not confuse /autoassist and /autostick--these are mutually exclusive features that may be used independently of each other. Examples: N/A AUTOTRAPS Syntax: /autotraps Description: Toggles automatic trap negotiation while not in combat. This feature will look for both box and floor traps, and disarm them when it finds one. If the feature is on, it will be turned off (and vice versa). Examples: N/A CHANNEL Syntax: /channel <channel> Description: With this command, you can control where RH directs it's output. Status information and general RH operations text will go to whatever channel you set. In essence, whatever text you supply here is suffixed after a \"/\" and then output strings are appended afterwards. \"Echo\" is the default channel. Creative users can use the IRC plugin and set the channel to \"I\" to send RH output to an existing IRC channel. Examples: Redirect RH output to chat channel 1: /channel 1 Redirect RH output to an irc channel (assuming you've loaded the MQ2IRC plugin and already joined a channel): /channel i Restore RH output to the MQ2 window (echo channel): /channel echo CLOSENESS Syntax: /closeness <%hitrange> Description: With this command you can set the percentage of the maximum range used in order to reach your target while autosticking. For some zones (Kael for example) the reported range is incorrect and too large--for such zones, set the closeness range to a smaller value such as 20 or 30. For most zones, 70% is adequate. Examples: Set the closeness value to 30%: /closeness 30 DRAG Syntax: /drag <body1> <body2> ... <bodyN> Description: Drag corpses. You must supply one or more player names as parameters (unlimited). In order to stop dragging bodies, target yourself (F1). Examples: Drag your friends Booger and Chooger: /drag booger chooger DYNAGGRO Syntax: /dynaggro Description: Toggles whether or not RH should be responsible for the your rogue's aggression level (only meaningful if you're using /autoassist). This feature will LOWER the percentage at which autoassist will fire by 1% if you were attacked during any given fight. If you were not attacked on the most recent fight, it will RAISE the percentage at which autoassist will fire by 1%. The assist percentage never stabilizes--it will always either go up or down after every fight. When using this command, if the feature is on, it will be turned off (and vice versa). Examples: N/A DYNCLOSE Syntax: /dynclose Description: Toggles whether or not RH should be responsible for the temporary automatic adjustment of the closeness to target (requires /autostick to be on). This feature will move you 20% closer to the target every two seconds, until you're in swinging range. Original closeness value is restored when the current target is killed. When using this command, if the feature is on, it will be turned off (and vice versa). Examples: N/A ENDFLOOR Syntax: /endfloor <%endurance> Description: With this command you can set the percentage of your endurance that is required in order for you to continue to initiate a fight with the strike discipline. When your endurance drops below this percentage value, you'll only autoattack when starting a fight. Examples: Set the strike endurance floor to 75%: /endfloor 75 IBOUNCE Syntax: /ibounce <itemalias> <\"Spell Name\"&#62; Description: This command is part of a set of three commands used to manage clickable items and their effects. This particular command allows you to set and store which spell effects do not stack with the spell effect created by a given clickable item. You may store an unlimited number of spell effects that \"bounce off\" of a given clickable item's effect. When RH maintains your clickable buffs, it will consult your existing buffs looking for these bounce spells prior to trying to re-click the conflicting item. Enclose spell names in double quotes (\" \")! The item in question must be aliased with the /iset command prior to using this command. Examples: Set two bounce effects for an item aliased as simply \"ring\" (perhaps a Coldain's Hero Ring), particularly Shield of Spikes and Shield of Thorns: /ibounce ring \"Shield of Spikes\" /ibounce ring \"Shield of Thorns\" ICLICK Syntax: /iclick <itemalias> Description: This command is part of a set of three commands used to manage clickable items and their effects. This particular command allows you to request RH to invoke the clickable effect for a given item. If you're not wearing the item, RH will fetch it, click it, put it back in it's original container (in it's original spot) and close the container. The item in question must be aliased with the /iset command prior to using this command. Examples: Have RH fetch the item aliased as \"ring\" (perhaps a Coldain's Hero Ring), and click it to invoke it's effect: /iclick ring ISET Syntax: /iset <itemalias> KEEPUP|NOKEEPUP <\"Item Name\"> Description: This command is part of a set of three commands used to manage clickable items and their effects. This particular command allows you to set and store an item alias for a given clickable item. You also can specify whether or not you want RH to automatically try to maintain the spell effect of this item. If a superior spell effect doesn't stack with the item's effect, you should use the /ibounce command to specify said spells. Examples: Have RH alias \"ring\" for your Coldain's Hero Ring, and also indicate you wish RH to maintain the Shield of the Eighth, if possible: /iset ring keepup \"Coldain Hero's Insignia Ring\" LEASH Syntax: /leash OFF|<distance> <master> Description: With the leash command, you can dynamically create one of two types of leashes and tether yourself to it: a stake-bound leash or a master-bound leash. If you specify just a distance and no master, /leash will drive a \"stake\" in the ground at your current position, and return to this point after you finish a combat. If you specify both distance and a master, after combats you'll return to the \"master's\" side, regardless of where the master is located. If you indicate OFF as a parameter instead of a distance, leashing will be turned off. Examples: Create a 200 foot leash that is attached to a virtual stake: /leash 200 Create a 250 foot leash that is attached to your warrior buddy named Booger: /leash 250 booger Turn all leashing off: /leash off LEASHFLEX Syntax: /leashflex <%length> Description: With this command you can set the threshold of when RH considers you to be \"close enough\" to the stake or master to stop moving toward it. If you set the leash flexibility very low (1), you'll return to the leash and nearly be on top of the stake or master. If you set the leash flexibility very high (100), you'll never return to the stake or master, but you won't go beyond your leash length when autosticking either. Examples: Set the leash flexibility to 50% of the leash's length: /leashflex 50 LOOTMYCORPSE Syntax: /lootmycorpse Description: With this command, you request RH to loot your entire corpse. Be warned that it's not aware of whether or not you've received a resurrection yet or not! If you're body is too far away or lag is too intense, it will abort with an appropriate failure message. Examples: N/A MAINASSIST Syntax: /mainassist <player> Description: This command is part of a set of three commands used to designate who you should autoassist, assuming you've activated the autoassist feature. This particular command sets the main assist (the main assist is also settable via /autoassist; however using autoassist both sets the main assist AND turns autoassist on--this command will only set the main assist). Examples: Make your buddy warrior \"Booger\" your main assist (but don't turn on autoassist): /mainassist booger PAUSE Syntax: /pause Description: The pause command suspends all of RH's operations. Use this if you want to temporarily disable RH without unloading it. Examples: N/A REMMASTER Syntax: /addmaster <name> Description: This command removes a \"master\" (an authorized remote controller) given the supplied name from the master control list stored within the RHSettings.INI file. It is a complimentary function to the ADDMASTER command. Examples: Remove the master named Hootey: /remmaster Hootey RHHELP Syntax: /rhhelp Description: This command will give you a very terse list of all of RH's commands and their abbreviated syntax. It is NO substitute for this manual! Examples: N/A SECONDASSIST Syntax: /secondassist <player> Description: This command is part of a set of three commands used to designate who you should autoassist, assuming you've activated the autoassist feature. This particular command sets the secondary assist. If the main assist dies, zones, or linkdies, RH will cascade to the secondary assist as a backup and will reinstate the main assist whenever they're alive or reconnect again. Examples: Make the dastardly shadowknight \"Drevil\" your secondary assist: /secondassist drevil STATUS Syntax: /status Description: The status command will show you the current state of all of RH's relevant functions (ON or OFF as TRUE or FALSE) as well as any user-defined values for those thresholds (endurance floors, stick distances, etc.) Examples: N/A STICKDIST Syntax: /stickdist <range_to_target> <range_to_tank> Description: With this command, you can regulate how close you must be to both your current target or the main assist in order to continue (or begin) autosticking to a given target. If you find yourself farther than the specified range to target or you've wandered farther than the specified range to your tank/mainassist, you will stop sticking to the target. This command is mostly useful to prevent you from chasing down runners when the main assist does not (or should not) as well as not running after mobs that recently gated far, far away. Examples: Set the maximum distance you'll pursue a mob at to 50 feet and the maximum \"wander\" distance from the tank to 100 feet: /stickdist 50 100 STOPFIGHT Syntax: /stopfight <%health> Description: With this command, you can control when RH turns off autoattack. Whenever your health reaches the specified percentage health parameter, RH will stop fighting. Examples: Cease combat when your health reaches 20% of it's maximum: /stopfight 20 STRIKEDISC Syntax: /strikedisc <strikeskill> Description: This command allows you to set your best available strike skill. The default skill is Assassin's Strike, but should you be lower level or been lucky enough to obtain later strike discipline books, this is the command you use to set the appropriate strike skill name. The name of the skill only has to be unique enough to differentiate it from other strike skills (i.e. ancient, kyv, or assassin are all fine). Examples: Set the strike skill to be used to \"Kyv's Strike\": /strikedisc kyv TARGETSWITCH Syntax: /targetswitch Description: Toggles whether or not RH should automatically choose a new target if the main assist does, or if it should \"finish off\" the current target. If your main assist is also the puller, you may want target switching OFF, as it will be expected that you finish off the last one before the next one is arrives. When using this command, if the feature is on, it will be turned off (and vice versa). Examples: N/A THIRDASSIST Syntax: /thirdassist <player> Description: This command is part of a set of three commands used to designate who you should autoassist, assuming you've activated the autoassist feature. This particular command sets the tertiary assist. If the main assist and secondary assist die, zone, or linkdie, RH will cascade to the tertiary assist as a backup's backup and will reinstate the main assist whenever they're alive or reconnect again. Examples: Make your friendly paladin \"Goodytwoshoes\" your tertiary assist: /thirdassist goodytwoshoes VERBOSITY Syntax: /verbosity 0|1|2 Description: With this command, you determine the level of text output that RH generates. A verbosity level of '0' will only output command switching information, but RH operational output will be almost completely silent. Verbosity level 1 shows all major RH activity. Verbosity level 2 shows everything, including ancillary RH background operations. The default is 2. Examples: Make RH almost completely mute: /verbosity 0 Have RH output all information possible: /verbosity 2 WEAPONSWITCH Syntax: /weaponswitch OFF|<weapon1> <\"switch text\"> <weapon2> Description: With this command, you can have RH automatically choose between two different weapons, depending on a settable situation. At the end of a combat, RH will restore weapon1 to your grasp. Whenever the supplied \"switch text\" is encountered (usually this the proc message, be it personal buff or target debuff) the weapon will be swapped out for weapon2 . WEAPONSWITCH is also smart enough to determine if the weapon procs a buff (in which case you'd probably like it to only switch back to weapon1 when the proc'ed buff wears off rather than after you finish off the mob. It handles this automatically. Make sure you do not typo the name of the weapons, or the switch text; also, the switch text does not need to be complete, but should be as complete as possible to not accidentally swap weapons around if someone speaks the trigger text. Weapons will be retrieved and deposited in any containers they come from (or on your character). Alternately, you can specify OFF as the first parameter to stop weaponswitching. Examples: Use Locustlure as your default weapon, but switch to the Horn of Hsagra if Locustlure procs: /weaponswitch Locustlure \"yawns.\" \"The Horn of Hsagra\" Use the Dart of Immobility as your default weapon, but switch to Ifir if your Dart procs: /weaponswitch \"Dart of Immobility\" \"screams as poison\" \"Ifir, Dagger of Fire\" Use a Primal Spear as your default weapon until you receive avatar, but switch to Ifir if your primal proc'ed and you still have avatar: /weaponswitch \"Primal Velium Spear\" \"Your body screams\" \"Ifir, Dagger of Fire\" Turn off weaponswitching: /weaponswitch OFF","title":"Command List:"},{"location":"macros/gallery/rogue-helper/","tags":["macro"],"text":"Rogue Helper \u00b6 RH.mac was originally designed to take some button mashing out of playing a rogue while raiding. This macro will execute \"smart\" backstabbing, constant evading (optionally), auto hiding and sneaking while not fighting, automatically avoid enrage riposte damage, stop fighting if you get below a certain health percentage, employ your chosen Strike discipline before wading into combat, and was later expanded to include a vast amount of other features. The latest versions of RH will also automatically assist specified tanks in a cascading fashion, automatically stick to a target (via internal code or using the MoveUtils plugin, smartly), will strafe in the most logical direction, display experience totals after combat, and optionally return after combat to a specified stake (or anchor) point. In addition to various combat abilities (along with their tunable parameters), RH also provides some rogue tools: multiple body dragging, self corpse looting, as well as a fully customizable item clicker (with the capability to automatically refresh self-clicked buffs), and automatic looting. A full list of features, their command syntax, and examples of how to use those commands is provided alphabetically below. Important Notice: \u00b6 RH will not function correctly , particularly in combat and more specifically with strike execution, unless you do the following things before using the macro: Make sure you have autoattack on assist OFF (/assist off) Modify your HOTKEY assist button to be ONLY an assist command and the following line: /echo Seeking a Victim... In other words, make a hotkey with the following two lines: /assist main /echo Seeking a Victim... If you fail to do these things, RH will function poorly! If your rogue still fails to assist your tank, try /Stick Off Features: \u00b6 RH provides you, the rogue, with an enormous amount of power. RH can do just about anything a rogue would need to do and can do almost all of it automatically. The following section briefly lists the features and capabilities that RH provides. Backstab while autoattack is on. Evade (optional) whenever hide is available during combat. Hide and sneak (optional) while not fighting. Pick the pockets of your enemies while fighting. Avoid riposte damage by disabling autoattack whenever enrage is detected and you're facing the target (if autoassist is on, autoattack is turned back on after the enrage wears off). Cease fighting when the rogue's health drops below a certain point. Open combats with a strike discipline (if hiding and sneaking and sufficient endurance is available). Automatically stick (maneuver behind) engaged targets in a VERY human-like way. You can specify how near you stick to the mob as a percentage of the maximum range to hit the target. You will \"circle strafe\" around targets in the smallest arc to find the target's rear. RH will try to back up and randomly move around obstacles if it gets stuck. If you suddenly find yourself tanking, sticking will be disabled to prevent you from dancing around the target indefinitely. Sticking will automatically take advantage of the MQ2MoveUtils plugin if it's loaded. Experience changes in regular, AA, and Group Leadership are reported as a percentage delta (change) after every experience gain. Create a virtual leash for your rogue and attach it to an NPC or player or to a virtual stake in the ground. You can customize the length of the leash. If your (or RH) tries to move you beyond the leash length, you will be yanked back to the maximum length. When not fighting, you'll return to the stake or the leash holder. Automatically assist another player and make ready to strike or auto attack when the target reaches a certain health percentage. Up to three (3) assists can be specified.. RH will cycle through all three assists, trying to assist each and stop when it finds that one of them is targeting an NPC. You can specify \"main\" as the first or main assist, and RH will follow raid-set main assists instead. Aggression level can optionally be controlled by RH (how soon to assist). RH can stay on an existing target until it's dead, or optionally engage a new target if the main assist chooses one. Drag an unlimited number of corpses (command line driven). Completely loot your own corpse. Automatically click items. You can define clickable items and use a command to have RH \"fetch\" them, use them, and put them back. Specified clickable effects can be designated as persistent (KEEPUP), and RH will automatically find the item and activate it's effect when the previously employed effect wears off. You can define which spells don't stack with your clickable items to prevent persistent effects from bouncing off of superior spells. * Ninjaloot any NPC corpses that are around you (after something dies). * Automatically scan and disarm traps. * Improved autofollow (far better than EQ's) which actually allows you to follow players in dungeons or follow NPCs, all at a specified range. Conditionally swap weapons after a specified proc-effect occurs in combat, be it a player buff or a detrimental target debuff. Fight in 3D-mode while swimming (target acquisition while underwater is inhumanly perfect). Determine when to take evasive action, including nimble discipline and potentially escape. Automatically employ two configurable disciplines of your choice (duelist, deadly precision, kinesthetics, etc.) Completely control macro output, both where it's displayed and the volume of text generated.

Some work great, while others work pretty well, but they all at the very least will give you some solid examples from which you can start to create your own fantactis scripts (which you will, of course, post here as an example :) Heal Script Examples \u00b6 Intelligent use of Promised Renewal \u00b6 Please note : \"PR\" has been added as a precondition for heals, so this script is no longer needed (although it is being left here as a good example). Please see the AdvHeal section of the ModBot wiki for information on using PR with AHPreCondition. Unlike most other heal spells, Promised Renewal lands as a buff on the target that heals after it fades (~18 seconds). The challenge in the current incarnation of ModHeal is that Modheal calculates the mob's dps and along with your target's time to live \\(ttl\\) without taking into account the PR buff - the end result is that it will often cast a big (and mana expensive) fast heal on your target five seconds before the PR buff fades. This script, created by Kroak, works to use PR correctly.

There's a couple of reasons this isn't the perfect solution - Rk. II versions of the spell will require a change in the ID checked. I don't have Rk. II, so this just checks for buff id 9755. Also, the PctHps\\<55 is a very important check. For harder fights you might want that a bit higher. The second line checks if you're attempting to cast CH and checks the duration of the buff against cast time of your heal. If you notice how long some of the lines are, you might guess why I'd like Netbots[X].Duration[Y] to take a spell name or ID instead of only listing by buff number. Anyways, my goal was to set this in my NetworkINI file, then AHPreCondition8=net-CHCheck on any toon that heals. It semi-works.

The challenge in the current incarnation of ModHeal is that Modheal calculates the mob's dps and along with your target's time to live \\(ttl\\) without taking into account the PR buff - the end result is that it will often cast a big (and mana expensive) fast heal on your target five seconds before the PR buff fades.

There's a couple of reasons this isn't the perfect solution - Rk. II versions of the spell will require a change in the ID checked. I don't have Rk. II, so this just checks for buff id 9755. Also, the PctHps\\<55 is a very important check. For harder fights you might want that a bit higher. The second line checks if you're attempting to cast CH and checks the duration of the buff against cast time of your heal. If you notice how long some of the lines are, you might guess why I'd like Netbots[X].Duration[Y] to take a spell name or ID instead of only listing by buff number.

Bot Flow \u00b6 After starting the macro if you do not have Aggro turned on or dps mode turned on it will just buff itself. If you have aggro on it's first going to look for mobs in a 50 radius range. It will automatically choose a name,mezzimmune, or the lowest HP mob within that radius. If there are no mobs in a 50 range radius then the macro will check if it has rez affects on. If so the macro will just buff itself and not try to aggro anything beyond the 50 radius. For mobs beyond the 50 radius it will look for mobs at a distance you set under \"Mobradius\". It will grab the highest level ,Named,mezzimmune mob and work it's way down. Macro does the initial aggro in 2 ways and both will be attempted to use. Will try to cast the first hate spell you have set in the ini and will try to use any range item like bow and arrow. If a mob goes into camp before you pulled enters camp it will switch to mob that's in camp. If the mob takes more then 20 seconds the camp the macro will clear the target, ignore that mob from pulling for 60 seconds and look for something else. If that mob eventually makes it into camp it will aggro the mob whether the timer is up or not. Once mob in camp it will stick to the mob. Use numerous Discs and spells such as demand for power,withstand,bite aa. Will constantly monitor health and will do lifetaps to keep it's self up. Will also nuke and dot. If it encounters a name it will using all tanking disciplines as well as dps disciples that stack with the tanking ones. Will use AA snare on any mobs that are trying to flee. Will keep any Skin or steely stance buffs up during combat. If more then one mop is in camp it will use ae aggro. If more then 3 mobs in camp and the health drops to low it will attempt to use deflection disc.","title":"Sk.mac - nytemyst"},{"location":"macros/gallery/sk.mac-nytemyst/#skmac-nytemyst","text":"","title":"Sk.mac - nytemyst"},{"location":"macros/gallery/sk.mac-nytemyst/#forum-link","text":"sk.mac - Nytemyst","title":"Forum Link"},{"location":"macros/gallery/sk.mac-nytemyst/#description","text":"This macro is mainly for high level shadow knights, but possible for low levels to use. this macro is designed with the toon having the ROF Expansion.

If you have aggro on it's first going to look for mobs in a 50 radius range. It will automatically choose a name,mezzimmune, or the lowest HP mob within that radius. If there are no mobs in a 50 range radius then the macro will check if it has rez affects on. If so the macro will just buff itself and not try to aggro anything beyond the 50 radius. For mobs beyond the 50 radius it will look for mobs at a distance you set under \"Mobradius\". It will grab the highest level ,Named,mezzimmune mob and work it's way down. Macro does the initial aggro in 2 ways and both will be attempted to use. Will try to cast the first hate spell you have set in the ini and will try to use any range item like bow and arrow. If a mob goes into camp before you pulled enters camp it will switch to mob that's in camp. If the mob takes more then 20 seconds the camp the macro will clear the target, ignore that mob from pulling for 60 seconds and look for something else. If that mob eventually makes it into camp it will aggro the mob whether the timer is up or not. Once mob in camp it will stick to the mob. Use numerous Discs and spells such as demand for power,withstand,bite aa. Will constantly monitor health and will do lifetaps to keep it's self up. Will also nuke and dot. If it encounters a name it will using all tanking disciplines as well as dps disciples that stack with the tanking ones. Will use AA snare on any mobs that are trying to flee. Will keep any Skin or steely stance buffs up during combat. If more then one mop is in camp it will use ae aggro.

It was originally written by ~rusty and later improved by A_Druid_00 (VIP version), and is probably the most-used inc file today. It's the de-facto standard include for any macro which requires the casting of a spell, an AA, or clicking of an item. As with many of the inc files on the forums, there are 2 versions of spell_routines.inc: Non-VIP . This is the original from ~rusty. VIP . This is the updated version, maintained by A_Druid_00. The VIP version has been improved slightly and it a bit smaller (and thus faster). It also improves speed by making use of the MQ2Exchange plugin which is available in the VIP area. Both versions are interchangeable, and there are only minor differences between them. Both are fully functional. Usage \u00b6 To make use of the Spell_Routines.inc file, save it to your main Macros directory and then add this to the top of your macro: #include Spell_Routines.inc After this, you can use the commands/functions listed below. /call Cast \u00b6 /call Cast \"spellname|itemname|AAname|AA#\" [item|alt|gem#] \"give up time\" \"custom subroutine name\" [\"Number of resist recasts\"] Note: Any of the above fields must use quotes if they are more than one word.

It doesn't matter if MQ is started while EverQuest is running or not. If you do start it after you start EverQuest, you will have to wait a few seconds before it finishes loading and you see the results in-game. MQ can be stopped from within game, by typing /unload . If you are running multiple sessions, you will have to do this in each session. After unloading, you can close the tray icon by right-clicking on it and chosing Exit. Multiple Sessions \u00b6 MacroQuest becomes part of EverQuest when you play, and anything you do inside one session is physically and logically separate from all others (just like your two copies of EverQuest dont blend together). This means that if you load a plugin in one session, it's not going to automatically load in the other. However, when you load a plugin, it will automatically load the next time a MacroQuest session begins. If that happens to be a second EQ session launching, then it may appear to your untrained eye as applying the plugin loading to all running sessions. Likewise, if you run a macro in one session, it's not going to automatically load in others. And if you run a command in one session, it's not going to automatically run in others. EQ Commands that are enhanced \u00b6 The following common EverQuest slash commands are enhanced by MacroQuest: /cast /charinfo /help /location /target /who /whotarget A full list is available in the Slash Commands page. MQ-only Commands \u00b6 The following commonly used slash commands are added by MacroQuest: /destroy /drop /echo /face /identify /itemtarget /macro /memspell /mqfont /mqpause /multiline /popup /plugin /ranged /skills /whofilter /unload A full list is available on the Slash Commands page. MacroQuest.ini \u00b6 NamingSpawn Article about manipulating the ini Macros and Plugins \u00b6 Macros \u00b6 You can load a macro with the following command: /macro`<arguments> eg. /macro autobot` To end a macro, use this command: /endmacro See the Getting Startaed section for further information on macros, and /macro and /endmacro for starting and stopping. Plugins \u00b6 MQ plugins are modular and can be loaded and unloaded on demand. To load a plugin, type: /plugin eg. /plugin mq2melee To unload a plugin: /pluginunload eg. /plugin mq2melee unload See the Plugins section for further information on plugins, and /plugin for starting and stopping. Custom UIs \u00b6 The EverQuest UI can also be enhanced through the use of MQ2 information. Things like your Target's level and class can be added to your Target Window, buff timers to your Buffs Window and other stats like mana regen, HP regen, Accuracy and Strikethrough to your Player Window. See the Custom UIs page for further information on what you can add, and how to do so. HUDs \u00b6 MacroQuest can enable a custom Heads Up Display to show almost any kind of data on top of your UI.

How to Build \u00b6 Download & Install Git for Windows \u00b6 Links and instructions can be found at: https://git-scm.com The recommended way to build MacroQuest is from a source code checkout using Git. There are many how to guides for installing and setting up git. Here is one of them Check Out the Latest Source Code \u00b6 Clone (create a local copy) the repository. This will create the subfolder macroquest that containes a copy of the source code. git clone https://github.com/macroquest/macroquest.git Initialize the submodules. Move (cd) to the newly created macroquest folder before executing this command. If you have run this step before, you can skip it. git submodule init Update the submodules to the newest versions. Ensure you are in the newly created macroquest folder before executing this command. git submodule update If this is your first time downloading the source code, proceed to Build Steps. Updating an Existing Checkout \u00b6 MacroQuest is updated often, especially after a patch. Make sure before you build that you have the latest source code for MacroQuest and all of its dependencies. If you already have the source, it is a good idea to make sure that you pull all the latest changes. git pull --rebase Update Submodules. This ensures that dependencies have the latest code. git submodule update At this point, the source should be ready to compile. Proceed to Build Steps. Build Steps (Live/Test) \u00b6 Open the MacroQuest.sln file in the src directory. Double clicking this file should open Visual Studio. If prompted to upgrade, click Cancel. Make sure your eqlib branch is on live or test Select the Release and (x64) configuration from the drop-down menu near the top of the window. Since the project moved to 64-bit, ensure all project configurations are set to (x64) in the Solution Macroquest Property Pages. From the Visual Studio main menu, select Build then Configuration Manager then ensure the Platform column for each project is set to (x64) . Select Build -> Build Solution from the menu. The built files will be placed in build/bin/Release . To start MacroQuest, run MacroQuest.exe . This will launch the application to the tray, and install MacroQuest into any running EverQuest processes. Build Steps (Emu) \u00b6 Open the MacroQuest.sln file in the src directory. Double clicking this file should open Visual Studio. If prompted to upgrade, click Cancel. Make sure your eqlib branch is on emu Select the Release and Win32 configuration from the drop-down menu near the top of the window. Select Build -> Build Solution from the menu. The built files will be placed in build/bin/Release . To start MacroQuest, run MacroQuest.exe . This will launch the application to the tray, and install MacroQuest into any running EverQuest processes. Building Live/Test/Emu from the same folder \u00b6 By default MacroQuest does not separate build outputs. Regardless whether you are building for Live or Test or Emu, all release outputs go to build/bin/release . However, macroquest does provide an option to separate these out further by setting the environment variable MQ_BUILD_SEPARATE to 1. When this environment variable is set to 1, the Client Target is added to your build path. For example, when building for Live your output path would be build/Live/bin/release while when building for Emu your output path would be build/Emu/bin/release . This allows you to share the same macroquest directory and just swap eqlib when you want to change client builds. Adding Your Own Plugins \u00b6 Note: If you have any custom plugins you want to build, put the sources for them in the plugins folder, for example: plugins/MQ2Foo/MQ2Foo.cpp Do not put them in src/plugins , this path is reserved for the MacroQuest developers. To add any personal plugins to the solution: Right-click the solution in the Solution Explorer and click Add -> Add Existing Project... Select your .vcxproj file Repeat as necessary Updating Plugins from Legacy MacroQuest \u00b6 If you are converting plugins over from Legacy MacroQuest (e.g. MQ2), it is recommended that you re-run the plugin generator first, and then copy your source files into the generated project. For example: cd plugins mkplugin MQ2Foo This will generate a MQ2Foo.vcxproj , MQ2Foo.cpp and several other files in a MQ2Foo folder.

It is interesting to note that many popular projects (black hat as well as white hat) seem to have been born there, or at least been somehow associated. Of note: WyvernX (also known as Admin) of XUnleashed, Ratt of ShowEQ, just some dude of EQWindows, and Mapfiend of RPG-Toolbox were some of the first registered users at HackersQuest. Plazmic first publicly announced what would be come MacroQuest in a post dated May 11 th , 2002, the date he joined HackersQuest. I'm currently working on a truely intelligent macro subsystem for EverQuest that can run while EQ is NOT the forground process. I have a test character that has levelled from 1 to 5 in North Qeynos chasing snakes and other things around, runs back to the gate to rest when low on health, and head to the merchants when low on packspace. Another character was running around Shadowhaven making and selling Pickled Gator meat for a small profit (really not worth the time) Would anyone be interested in this type of a macro program? I'm not sure fully what Xylobot offers, but I figure background macroing would be a hit nevertheless. A poll attached to the post turned up 3 votes -- one for \"I'd rather use Xylobot\", one for \"Running a macro in the background would be cool\", and one for \"Sign me up for the beta!\". A little bit less than a month later he posted again, this time with a link to a new site at sourceforge . The project was called MacroQuest, and would later become the most successful and popular tool for automating EverQuest_._ This new utility was originally only available for Windows 2000 and XP users, but later adapted for Windows 98 and ME. It boasted new commands that could be used directly in EverQuest, with variables and a macro language -- and even came with some macros, including a fletching macro to make arrows. Note: Credit for writing the above text goes to Feonix762. MacroQuest 2 \u00b6 Macroquest2 was developed from the existing MacroQuest project, initially by Lax. You may find the original post about MacroQuest2 replacing MacroQuest here . Post subject: Nonbelievers of Lax soon to be disproven! In the last 3 days I have been working hard to redefine the future of Macroquest. The people who have seen the work this far are pleased, and the time draws near to actually allow public beta testing. Please note that nothing in the current MQ will be changed, or broken. This will be an entirely new distribution, from the same place. For now the project is dubbed MQ2. So what is MQ2? MQ2 is an EverQuest development platform, with some default functionality. The development platform is so good, in fact, that it is second only to having the current EQ source code. Gone are the days for inline assembly (99% of it anyway) in MQ. Now we have a much cleaner and easier method of stealing! What was previously 10 lines of inline assembly, is now 1 line that looks like pEverQuest->dsp_chat(Line,Color);... MQ2 is plugin-based. There is a main DLL, MQ2Main, which contains the API needed to create plugins that do pretty much anything. Plugins simply include a \"MQ2Plugin.h\" header file and instantly gain access to everything in MQ2Main, all of the data structures, etc. To add custom commands, you use AddCommand. To add custom ParseMacroParameters parms, like $char, you use AddParm. To add a detour, you use AddDetour. To execute code on every MQ pulse, you make copy the plugin template function OnPulse(). And so on. It's incredibly simple. Many people have great ideas like bazaar functionality.. .. and many have things they do not want to share, and don't want to have to diff in their changes every time they get a new source. Now, instead of the cumbersome \"EQLib_Custom.cpp\", you simply make a plugin and it's independent. What sort of plugins...? Several features of \"old\" Macroquest are removed from the main system. Namely: FPS Limiter, Chat (including the windows), Map labelling, UI Labels, Item display mods, Telnet. Plugins can handle all of these and more. In fact, most of the features just listed already have been developed in plugin form. A little more testing by developers and things will be ready. Can my plugin use another plugin as an API? Sure. You probably shouldn't try to use things from plugins that arent designed to be API. Export things from the API plugin, and import them in the functional plugin, and make sure the functional plugin is using the .lib from the API plugin in addition to the others needed. What does this mean for us right NOW, not tomorrow when we can get this? MQ2 is a couple days behind as far as new features and fixes implemented in the \"old\" macroquest CVS. Anything implemented since a few days ago will have to be re-done into MQ2. I'm working fast to keep this delta as small as possible. WHEN DOES BETA START It should not be long before we have a zip for you to download for beta testing. Beta testing will last as long as it takes to get the plugins tested, which will not be long. Once the default set of plugins is working, we can call it a \"stable\" release.","title":"History Of MacroQuest"},{"location":"main/history-of-macroquest/#history-of-macroquest","text":"","title":"History Of MacroQuest"},{"location":"main/history-of-macroquest/#macroquest","text":"In 1999, a site called HackersQuest opened its doors with public forums. It is interesting to note that many popular projects (black hat as well as white hat) seem to have been born there, or at least been somehow associated. Of note: WyvernX (also known as Admin) of XUnleashed, Ratt of ShowEQ, just some dude of EQWindows, and Mapfiend of RPG-Toolbox were some of the first registered users at HackersQuest. Plazmic first publicly announced what would be come MacroQuest in a post dated May 11 th , 2002, the date he joined HackersQuest. I'm currently working on a truely intelligent macro subsystem for EverQuest that can run while EQ is NOT the forground process. I have a test character that has levelled from 1 to 5 in North Qeynos chasing snakes and other things around, runs back to the gate to rest when low on health, and head to the merchants when low on packspace. Another character was running around Shadowhaven making and selling Pickled Gator meat for a small profit (really not worth the time) Would anyone be interested in this type of a macro program? I'm not sure fully what Xylobot offers, but I figure background macroing would be a hit nevertheless. A poll attached to the post turned up 3 votes -- one for \"I'd rather use Xylobot\", one for \"Running a macro in the background would be cool\", and one for \"Sign me up for the beta!\". A little bit less than a month later he posted again, this time with a link to a new site at sourceforge . The project was called MacroQuest, and would later become the most successful and popular tool for automating EverQuest_._ This new utility was originally only available for Windows 2000 and XP users, but later adapted for Windows 98 and ME. It boasted new commands that could be used directly in EverQuest, with variables and a macro language -- and even came with some macros, including a fletching macro to make arrows.

You may find the original post about MacroQuest2 replacing MacroQuest here . Post subject: Nonbelievers of Lax soon to be disproven! In the last 3 days I have been working hard to redefine the future of Macroquest. The people who have seen the work this far are pleased, and the time draws near to actually allow public beta testing. Please note that nothing in the current MQ will be changed, or broken. This will be an entirely new distribution, from the same place. For now the project is dubbed MQ2. So what is MQ2? MQ2 is an EverQuest development platform, with some default functionality. The development platform is so good, in fact, that it is second only to having the current EQ source code. Gone are the days for inline assembly (99% of it anyway) in MQ. Now we have a much cleaner and easier method of stealing! What was previously 10 lines of inline assembly, is now 1 line that looks like pEverQuest->dsp_chat(Line,Color);... MQ2 is plugin-based.

Microsoft's vcpkg is a compile-from-source library manager that uses cmake to compile the library on the system it is needed. This has the benefits of both distributing a lib AND distributing source to make it easy to compile libs so that you don't have to worry about which directories to include and setup. For MacroQuest, we have slightly modified the way that vcpkg works. Installation of vcpkg \u00b6 While you can bootstrap and install vcpkg yourself and it will work, it is easier to let MacroQuest's build scripts handle this for you. The first time that you build MacroQuest from the sln file, vcpkg will bootstrap itself. From that point, the vcpkg.exe will exist in contrib/vcpkg and this is the file that can be used to search for packages. Because of the modifications for MacroQuest, you do not need to run vcpkg integrate or vcpkg integrate install. Installation of packages \u00b6 vcpkg_mq is setup to use custom manifests to install required packages. These manifests are automatically set with the static triplet to match your architecture. Including packages with your plugin or project requires that you create a manifest file next to your vcxproj. In that same directory, you'll create vcpkg_mq.txt with a list of the packages that your project requires. The packages are separated by line breaks and mimic the format that you would use on the command line to install a package. The triplet is only required if it is different from your architecture or if you don't want it to be static. For example, if you wanted yaml-cpp and sleepy-discord, but you wanted the websocketpp feature of sleepy-discord, your vcpkg_mq.txt manifest would look like: vcpkg_mq.txt yaml-cpp sleepy-discord[websocketpp] Next time that you build, these packages will be automatically installed. Inclusion of libraries in your project \u00b6 If you are building a plugin or one of the core projects, the include paths for headers and libraries are already set. Just #include \"yourlibrary.h\" as you normally would and add any .lib file to your dependency list. You do not need to add the paths unless your library installs to a non-standard location or a subdirectory. This can be done through the Visual Studio interface, but below is an example of what a vcxproj might look like when adding yaml-cpp to the list of dependencies: <ItemDefinitionGroup Condition= \"'$(Configuration)|$(Platform)'=='Debug|Win32'\" > <Link> <AdditionalDependencies> libyaml-cppmdd.lib;%(AdditionalDependencies) </AdditionalDependencies> </Link> </ItemDefinitionGroup> <ItemDefinitionGroup Condition= \"'$(Configuration)|$(Platform)'=='Release|Win32'\" > <Link> <AdditionalDependencies> libyaml-cppmd.lib;%(AdditionalDependencies) </AdditionalDependencies> </Link> </ItemDefinitionGroup> If you do need to set specific paths, make sure that those paths are relative. Updates \u00b6 When you update the repository, vcpkg_mq will update itself if you have git installed in your path. When the git hash for the submodule changes, vcpkg_mq will manage its own updates both for the executable and for any installed packages, there is nothing you need to do. To force an update of vcpkg, delete the following file: contrib/vcpkg/vcpkg_mq_last_bootstrap.txt This typically only needs to be done when the vcpkg repo is updated, but is also helpful for testing.

It is mostly useful in streaming/recording applications with the hope that any identifying information is not visible to others. This, of course, is an intractable problem so the best that we can do is filter words and hope it works. It is by no means a perfect safety tool and if the user cares about anonymity, should be used in service of supporting a larger anonymization strategy. Word of Warning \u00b6 This plugin will only filter in game . What that means is that any text at server select, character select, login, etc will not be filtered . Please make any considerations necessary to prevent visibility of the client outside of actual in-game experiences. How Your Plugin Can Anonymize \u00b6 MQ2Anonymize cannot control what plugin authors do, so instead we provide the API to anonymize any text that the plugin may render if anonymization is turned on . We are able to anonymize central points of text display (such as writing the the MQ2 console with WriteChatColor and variants of it), but anything that renders text outside those plugins will need to have explicit API calls to Anonymize() . For plugin authors: when in doubt make sure to test that anonymization works in game with your plugin before releasing it! API \u00b6 The API is very simple: CXStr& Anonymize(CXStr& Text) The signature is such that it satisfies 2 things: can be linked via C-style linkage for use externally, and can be called in-line. The function uses Text as a buffer and returns it as a result. This means that the plugin writer will need to allocate the CXStr passed to the appropriate scope (usually on the stack is fine), but since it's not a c-string, we don't need to support MAX_STRING allocations on the stack anymore. This also has the advantage of using EQ's native string class ( CXStr ) so it should be very easy to integrate. Example \u00b6 CXStr text ( text_to_anonymize ); text = Anonymize ( text ); End-User Instructions \u00b6 In order to enable anonymization, the end-user (player) needs to do some setup. Turning it on and off is simple: /mqanon will simply toggle the active state of anonymization. All interaction with this functionality is done with arguments to this command, here is a brief summary. Important Note: Due to the quirky nature of how EQ sets bone sprite text, we have implemented anon into the captions code. If you want name sprites to anonymize, you must turn captions on with /caption MQCaptions on !

This means that the plugin writer will need to allocate the CXStr passed to the appropriate scope (usually on the stack is fine), but since it's not a c-string, we don't need to support MAX_STRING allocations on the stack anymore.

So I'm creating a thread in Macro Mania because it's to do with coding logic that follows along the same guidelines as the MQ2HUD.ini in a way. I'm talking about the [Captions] section of Macroquest.ini that most people don't even know exists. The [Captions] section uses a little known TLO that's not echoable in MQ2 that inherits the \"Spawn\" datatype to display information on NPC's and players. It's the code that shows you the details of player/NPC/pet spawns in MQ2. Why do you care? Well recently I created a HUD that got a lot of positive attention. the logic used to create the HUD is a lot like the logic that will be used to explain the captions section of Macroquest.ini What can you do with [Captions] section of the Macroquest2.ini, well. See for yourself what I've done in a few minutes of coding using the ${NamingSpawn} TLO. This is an altered form of the [Captions] section of the macroquest.ini I've changed NPC= section to display the information I want to see. The ${NamingSpawn} inherits the spawn data type. https://macroquest.org/wiki/index.php/DataType:spawn While the wiki is certainly dated, just with that link alone you can find a lot of information. Basically anything you see in that list should be allowed to attach to the end of ${NamingSpawn}. You can test them with ${Target.datamember} IE: ${NamingSpawn.Body} will display \"Humaniod\", \"Animal\", \"Plant\", \"Undead\", etc so you can just look at the targets name and see if you can use your body specific spells/banestrike. I've added distance using ${NamingSpawn.Distance} and there is a lot more that you can add that I just haven't done yet. Limitations - You're only allowed two lines. So while you can \\n to go to a next line, you can only do this once as two lines is the maximum. Player1, Player2, Player3, etc......what does it mean? The players are directly attached to /shownames 1, 2, 3, 4 etc in game. This only applies to player information. So if you want /shownames 1 to not show anything at all, you can do something like. Player1= \\({If[\\) ,,]} Someone recently mentioned mobs Feigning Death in EQ. Well perhaps you want to add ${NamingSpawn.Feigning} to the display of NPC's? \\({If[\\) ,FD,]} will display FD if the NPC is FD. Want to know what spell a player is casting? Add \\({If[\\) , Casting: ${NamingSpawn.Casting},]} to the Player# you want to show that information. Great for PVP when you want to stop a player from casting a heal by stunning them but don't want to waste your bash/stun on a trivial spell that won't save their life. /evil grin.

The MacroQuest parser first parses from left to right to tokenize the variables that need to be parsed. That means in the command: /echo My name is ${Me.Name} and my class is ${Me.Class}. MacroQuest first parses ${Me.Name} so that the above becomes: My name is Knightly and my class is ${Me.Class}. And then parses ${Me.Class} so that the above returns: [MQ2] My name is Knightly and my class is Programancer. Nested queries are processed from right to left AFTER it has been tokenized. What this means is that in: /echo My ID is ${Spawn[=${Me.Name}].ID} and my class is ${Me.Class}. MacroQuest first tokenizes to get ${Spawn[=${Me.Name}].ID} and then parses ${Me.Name} becoming: My ID is ${Spawn[=Knightly].ID} and my class is ${Me.Class}. Since there are still items to parse it continues to the left to get: My ID is 007 and my class is ${Me.Class}. And finally returns: [MQ2] My ID is 007 and my class is Programancer The exception to this is when you override the parser with the ${Parse[]} functionality. This tells the parser to \"START HERE\" on any tokenized string. The outermost Parse function always wins. The number after the brace tells the Parse override how many times to iterate. This means in the command: /echo My ID is ${Parse[0,${Spawn[=${Me.Name}].ID}]} and my class is ${Me.Class}. MacroQuest first tokenizes to get ${Parse[0,${Spawn[=${Me.Name}].ID}]} and, because there is a ${Parse[]} that gets evaluated first. In this case, the parse is 0 which means \"do not parse\" so this becomes: My ID is ${Spawn[=${Me.Name}].ID} and my class is ${Me.Class}. And MacroQuest moves on to evaluating the ${Me.Class} token to output: [MQ2] My ID is ${Spawn[=${Me.Name}].ID} and my class is Programancer. You can use this to stop the parsing after one iteration: /echo My ID is ${Parse[1,${Spawn[=${Me.Name}].ID}]} and my class is ${Me.Class}. MacroQuest first tokenizes to get ${Parse[1,${Spawn[=${Me.Name}].ID}]} and because there is a ${Parse[]} that gets evaluated first. In this case, the parse is 1 which means \"parse one time\" so this becomes: My ID is ${Parse[0,${Spawn[=Knightly].ID}]} and my class is ${Me.Class}. Which then becomes: My ID is ${Spawn[=Knightly].ID} and my class is ${Me.Class}. And MacroQuest moves on to evaluating the ${Me.Class} token to output: [MQ2] My ID is ${Spawn[=Knightly].ID} and my class is Programancer. Setting this to higher numbers allows you to iterate as many times as necessary, but each iteration only parses the innermost variable. That means, too many iterations will end up as if you hadn't used ${Parse[]} at all. In this same scenario consider if we used 2 iterations: /echo My ID is ${Parse[2,${Spawn[=${Me.Name}].ID}]} and my class is ${Me.Class}. Again, starting with the first token ${Parse[2,${Spawn[=${Me.Name}].ID}]} the line becomes: My ID is ${Parse[1,${Spawn[=Knightly].ID}]} and my class is ${Me.Class}. And then the next iteration it becomes: My ID is ${Parse[0,007]} and my class is ${Me.Class}. And then: My ID is 007 and my class is ${Me.Class}. Until, finally, the Parse section is done and the parser moves on to ${Me.Class} and outputs: [MQ2] My ID is 007 and my class is Programancer. So you can see that in this case ${Parse[2,${Spawn[=${Me.Name}].ID}]} and ${Spawn[=${Me.Name}].ID} are functionally equivalent. Parse priority is also true for NESTED parses, so the outermost parse gets evaluated first and the action on that determines how the inner parses will get handled. Consider for example: /echo This test is ${Parse[0,${Parse[1,${Me.Name}]}]}. Which will return: [MQ2] This test is ${Parse[1,${Me.Name}]}. Changing the first 0 to a 1 to make the command: /echo This test is ${Parse[1,${Parse[1,${Me.Name}]}]}. Will become: This test is ${Parse[0,${Parse[0,Knightly]}]}. Which will return: [MQ2] This test is ${Parse[0,Knightly]} Finally, swapping the 0 and 1 from the first command will make the command: /echo This test is ${Parse[1,${Parse[0,${Me.Name}]}]}. Which will become: This test is ${Parse[0,${Me.Name}]}.

In this case, the parse is 0 which means \"do not parse\" so this becomes: My ID is \\( \\textcolor{red}{\\text{\\$\\{Spawn[=\\$\\{Me.Name\\}].ID\\}}} \\) and my class is \\( \\textcolor{green}{\\text{\\$\\{Me.Class\\}}} \\) . And MacroQuest moves on to evaluating the \\( \\textcolor{green}{\\text{\\$\\{Me.Class\\}}} \\) token to output: [MQ2] My ID is ${Spawn[=${Me.Name}].ID} and my class is Programancer. You can use this to stop the parsing after one iteration: /echo My ID is \\( \\textcolor{red}{\\text{\\$\\{Parse[1,}} \\) \\( \\textcolor{purple}{\\text{\\$\\{Spawn[=}} \\) \\( \\textcolor{teal}{\\text{\\$\\{Me.Name\\}}} \\) \\( \\textcolor{purple}{\\text{].ID\\}}} \\) \\( \\textcolor{red}{\\text{]\\}}} \\) and my class is \\( \\textcolor{green}{\\text{\\$\\{Me.Class\\}}} \\) . MacroQuest first tokenizes to get \\( \\textcolor{red}{\\text{\\$\\{Parse[1,}} \\) \\( \\textcolor{purple}{\\text{\\$\\{Spawn[=}} \\) \\( \\textcolor{teal}{\\text{\\$\\{Me.Name\\}}} \\) \\( \\textcolor{purple}{\\text{].ID\\}}} \\) \\( \\textcolor{red}{\\text{]\\}}} \\) and because there is a \\( \\textcolor{red}{\\text{\\$\\{Parse[]\\}}} \\) that gets evaluated first. In this case, the parse is 1 which means \"parse one time\" so this becomes: My ID is \\( \\textcolor{red}{\\text{\\$\\{Parse[1,}} \\) \\( \\textcolor{purple}{\\text{\\$\\{Spawn[=}} \\) \\( \\textcolor{teal}{\\text{Knightly}} \\) \\( \\textcolor{purple}{\\text{].ID\\}}} \\) \\( \\textcolor{red}{\\text{]\\}}} \\) and my class is \\( \\textcolor{green}{\\text{\\$\\{Me.Class\\}}} \\) . Which then becomes: My ID is \\( \\textcolor{red}{\\text{\\$\\{Spawn[=Knightly].ID\\}\\}}} \\) and my class is \\( \\textcolor{green}{\\text{\\$\\{Me.Class\\}}} \\) . And MacroQuest moves on to evaluating the \\( \\textcolor{green}{\\text{\\$\\{Me.Class\\}}} \\) token to output: [MQ2] My ID is ${Spawn[=Knightly].ID} and my class is Programancer. Setting this to higher numbers allows you to iterate as many times as necessary, but each iteration only parses the innermost variable. That means, too many iterations will end up as if you hadn't used ( \\textcolor{red}{\\text{\\$\\{Parse[]\\}}} \\) at all. In this same scenario consider if we used 2 iterations: /echo My ID is \\( \\textcolor{red}{\\text{\\$\\{Parse[2,}} \\) \\( \\textcolor{purple}{\\text{\\$\\{Spawn[=}} \\) \\( \\textcolor{teal}{\\text{\\$\\{Me.Name\\}}} \\) \\( \\textcolor{purple}{\\text{].ID\\}}} \\) \\( \\textcolor{red}{\\text{]\\}}} \\) and my class is \\( \\textcolor{green}{\\text{\\$\\{Me.Class\\}}} \\) . Again, starting with the first token \\( \\textcolor{red}{\\text{\\$\\{Parse[2,}} \\) \\( \\textcolor{purple}{\\text{\\$\\{Spawn[=}} \\) \\( \\textcolor{teal}{\\text{\\$\\{Me.Name\\}}} \\) \\( \\textcolor{purple}{\\text{].ID\\}}} \\) \\( \\textcolor{red}{\\text{]\\}}} \\) the line becomes: My ID is \\( \\textcolor{red}{\\text{\\$\\{Parse[1,}} \\) \\( \\textcolor{purple}{\\text{\\$\\{Spawn[=}} \\) \\( \\textcolor{teal}{\\text{Knightly}} \\) \\( \\textcolor{purple}{\\text{].ID\\}}} \\) \\( \\textcolor{red}{\\text{]\\}}} \\) and my class is \\( \\textcolor{green}{\\text{\\$\\{Me.Class\\}}} \\) . And then the next iteration it becomes: My ID is \\( \\textcolor{red}{\\text{\\$\\{Parse[0,}} \\) \\( \\textcolor{purple}{\\text{007}} \\) \\( \\textcolor{red}{\\text{]\\}}} \\) and my class is \\( \\textcolor{green}{\\text{\\$\\{Me.Class\\}}} \\) . And then: My ID is \\( \\textcolor{purple}{\\text{007}} \\) and my class is \\( \\textcolor{green}{\\text{\\$\\{Me.Class\\}}} \\) . Until, finally, the Parse section is done and the parser moves on to \\( \\textcolor{green}{\\text{\\$\\{Me.Class\\}}} \\) and outputs: [MQ2] My ID is 007 and my class is Programancer. So you can see that in this case \\( \\textcolor{red}{\\text{\\$\\{Parse[2,}} \\) \\( \\textcolor{purple}{\\text{\\$\\{Spawn[=}} \\) \\( \\textcolor{teal}{\\text{\\$\\{Me.Name\\}}} \\) \\( \\textcolor{purple}{\\text{].ID\\}}} \\) \\( \\textcolor{red}{\\text{]\\}}} \\) and \\( \\textcolor{purple}{\\text{\\$\\{Spawn[=}} \\) \\( \\textcolor{teal}{\\text{\\$\\{Me.Name\\}}} \\) \\( \\textcolor{purple}{\\text{].ID\\}}} \\) are functionally equivalent. Parse priority is also true for NESTED parses, so the outermost parse gets evaluated first and the action on that determines how the inner parses will get handled. Consider for example: /echo This test is \\( \\textcolor{orange}{\\text{\\$\\{Parse[0,}} \\) \\( \\textcolor{red}{\\text{\\$\\{Parse[1,}} \\) \\( \\textcolor{teal}{\\text{\\$\\{Me.Name\\}}} \\) \\( \\textcolor{red}{\\text{]\\}}} \\) \\( \\textcolor{orange}{\\text{]\\}}} \\) . Which will return: [MQ2] This test is ${Parse[1,${Me.Name}]}. Changing the first 0 to a 1 to make the command: /echo This test is \\( \\textcolor{orange}{\\text{\\$\\{Parse[1,}} \\) \\( \\textcolor{red}{\\text{\\$\\{Parse[1,}} \\) \\( \\textcolor{teal}{\\text{\\$\\{Me.Name\\}}} \\) \\( \\textcolor{red}{\\text{]\\}}} \\) \\( \\textcolor{orange}{\\text{]\\}}} \\) . Will become: This test is \\( \\textcolor{orange}{\\text{\\$\\{Parse[0,}} \\) \\( \\textcolor{red}{\\text{\\$\\{Parse[0,}} \\) \\( \\textcolor{teal}{\\text{Knightly}} \\) \\( \\textcolor{red}{\\text{]\\}}} \\) \\( \\textcolor{orange}{\\text{]\\}}} \\) . Which will return: [MQ2] This test is ${Parse[0,Knightly]} Finally, swapping the 0 and 1 from the first command will make the command: /echo This test is \\( \\textcolor{orange}{\\text{\\$\\{Parse[1,}} \\) \\( \\textcolor{red}{\\text{\\$\\{Parse[0,}} \\) \\( \\textcolor{teal}{\\text{\\$\\{Me.Name\\}}} \\) \\( \\textcolor{red}{\\text{]\\}}} \\) \\( \\textcolor{orange}{\\text{]\\}}} \\) . Which will become: This test is \\( \\textcolor{red}{\\text{\\$\\{Parse[0,}} \\) \\( \\textcolor{teal}{\\text{\\$\\{Me.Name\\}}} \\) \\( \\textcolor{red}{\\text{]\\}}} \\) . And then output: [MQ2] This test is ${Me.Name}","title":"Explanation Colorized (requires LaTeX viewer)"},{"location":"main/other-applications/eqemu/","text":"EQEmu \u00b6 General \u00b6 EQEmu (or EQEmulator) is a free (under GNU GPL) open source EverQuest server emulator.

UltraEdit chooses for the different categories. To do that navigate to: Advanced \u2192 Configuration \u2192 Editor Display \u2192 Syntax Highlighting and you can change the colors to your own choosing. Indenting \u00b6 Ultraedit will also perform automatic indenting for you. It will create an indent whenever it see you have an open \"{\" and will unindent whenever it see a closing \"}\". You can also manually reformat any section by highlighting it then choosing Format \u2192 Indent Section from the UltraEdit Menu. Note: There is currently one bug in how indenting works. It currently does not properly unindent /elseif statements. UltraEdit will also not bring the final \"}\" back to the beginning of the first if like it is supposed to.

For example, a macro may help you do automatically mez mobs within a certain range, or auto-attack mob within a certain range. A plugin may control lower level functions like casting the mez spell for you (ie. making sure you have the right target, auto-recasting if you fizzle, etc) or control movement to your intended victim and activating attack (ie. moving you to melee range, turning on attack, automatically backstabbing, turning off attack on enrage, etc). The functionality of plugins and macros often overlap, and in the above example its completely possible to do all the above using just a macro with no plugins. Plugins are written in C++ whereas macros use MQ2's internal scripting language. The internal scripting language is a lot easier to use and manipulate than C++, which is why you'll find a lot more macros than plugins on the MQ2 message boards. Finding Plugins \u00b6 Plugins can be found in the following forum: MQ2::Development::Plugins (VIP Only) ImaNoob posted a very helpful thread here. (VIP Only) Titled appropriately \"The Complete Idiots Guide to MQ2 and plugins\" Compiling Plugins \u00b6 Say you've seen an interesting looking plugin on the forums and you'd like to try it out, how exactly do you go about doing it? Open up a command prompt (Windows key + R, type \"cmd\" without quotation marks, press enter) and navigate to your MQ2 source directory (eg. cd \\mq2-latest ). Type \" mkplugin \". Use the name of the plugin from the forum post (eg. \" mkplugin MQ2Melee \"). This will create the directory under your MQ2 source root and add a few files in there. Go to this directory in Explorer and open the .cpp file (eg. MQ2Melee.cpp) in your favourite text editor (notepad will work just fine). If you don't have any file extensions on your files (ie. none of them end with .cpp), then in Explorer go to Tools - Folder Options - View tab and untick \"Hide file extensions for known file types\". Replace the contents of this file with the code copied from the forum post. This code will generally start with a header indicating the name of the plugin, author, and maybe a brief description of the function of the plugin. An example of the first few lines of the MQ2Melee plugin are below: //=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=// // MQ2Melee.cpp | // Author: s0rCieR | // Version: 3.000 | // Date: 20060213 |yes it should be //=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=// // #define aabug when alt abilities broken! // #define cabug when combat abilities broken! //=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=// #include <mq/Plugin.h> PreSetup ( \"MQ2Melee\" ); PLUGIN_VERSION ( 3.000 ); Some plugins require additional files to be included as well (eg. .ccp, .h or .inc). Just create these files in the plugin directory with the names as given in the forum post. **Make sure to save them as plain text documents with the correct extension (ie. do not save them with .txt extension) otherwise the plugin will not find them.** After you've got the plugin created and all the files copied, open up the main MacroQuest2 project and add your newly created project: In VS 6, Go to Projects->Insert Projects into workspace, then select .dsp (eg. MQ2Melee.dsp). In VS .NET, go to File->Add Project->Existing project, and select the .vcproj (eg. MQ2Melee.vcproj). In VS 2005 AND NEWER , go to File->Add->Existing project, and select the .vcproj (or .vcxproj in newer versions of VS} (eg. MQ2Melee.vcproj or MQ2Melee.vcxproj). Compile the plugin: In VS 2005 and newer, click on the plugin name in the Solution Explorer window, then click Build->Build . Using Plugins \u00b6 MQ2 plugins are modular and can be loaded and unloaded on demand. See /plugin for information on loading and unloading plugins. If you need help with the plugin, you can most often find it within the main forum post or within the Wiki entry for that plugin. Some plugins have a built in help which can often be accessed in-game by typing the name of the plugin's slash command(s) followed by help, or just the slash command \\(s\\) by itself. (more examples?) For example, in the MQ2MoveUtils plugin, the plugin adds the /moveto and /makecamp slash commands. Typing \" /moveto help \" and \" /makecamp help \" will bring up a list of current options for that part of the MQ2MoveUtils plugin.

The official forum thread for MQ2Cast is here \\(VIP Only\\) . Features \u00b6 Reliably casts spells \\(auto-recasts on fizzles or gate collapses\\) . Will attempt to immobilize you before casting. Will cast immediately a spell is available, before the gem is even fully ready. Intelligently and reliably memorizes spells and allows saving and loading of custom spell sets. Will attempt to immobilize you if moving. Clicks items and activates AAs. Will equip items in bags before clicking, and then return them once clicked. Utilizes MQ2Bandolier to swap in sets of items before casting \\(ie. Focus items\\) . Auto-pause Stick and/or Advpath if detected and resume when complete. Custom interrupt function, to interrupt spells during casting \\(includes dismounting\\) . Returns control to the macro immediately after it has started \\(ie. while the spell is casting\\) , to allow the macro to perform other checks. Eg. while casting a heal spell, you could get the macro to check if the target has already been healed and then interrupt your spell if his HPs are above a certain amount. Requirements \u00b6 MQ2Bandolier For swapping in sets of items before casting \\(ie. focus items\\) MQ2Exchange For equipping clickies before using them Commands \u00b6 /casting \u00b6 Syntax: /casting \"Name\" [type] [options] Although the type is optional, it's always recommended to specify if you're casting a spell \\(specify the gem or number\\) , clicking an item \\(specify \"item\" or the slot name/slot number\\) or activating an AA \\(specify \"alt\"\\) , since there are AAs which have the same name as spells and spells and items can have the same IDs. The /casting command requires only 1 argument, the name of the spell you wish to cast. If the spell is not memmed, it will try and mem it in gem5 \\(this is the default if no gem is specified\\) . If the spell has more than one word, make sure to surround it with quotes. For example: /casting \"Minor Shielding\" This will cast the Minor Shielding spell if it is already memmed, or if not, will attempt to memorize it in gem5 before casting. You can also include the gem number \\(or just the number\\) after the name of the spell, to indicate which gem it should be memmed into. For example: /casting \"Minor Shielding\" 1 /casting \"Minor Shielding\" gem1 These will both cast Minor Shielding if memmed, or memorize it in gem1 before casting. The gem number can also be appended to the end of the spell name, separated by a pipe command, like so: /casting \"Minor Shielding|gem1\" /casting \"Minor Shielding|1\" You can also use the ID of the spell you wish to mem/cast. The following 4 examples all do the same thing: /casting 288|gem1 /casting 288|1 /casting 288 gem1 /casting 288 1 All of the above will cast \"Minor Shielding\" \\(ID 288\\) and mem it in gem1 if not already memmed. When clicking items you use the same syntax, except the \"name\" of the spell is the name of the item or the item's ID. It's always recommended to specify the type as \"item\" or specify the slot name/slot ID if you are clicking an item. For example: /casting \"Fabled Journeyman's Boots\" item /casting 68239|item /casting \"Shrunken Goblin Skull Earring\" leftear Options: The following optional parameters can be added to the /casting line: -bandolier| Equip the bandolier with before casting. Useful for focus effects. -invis With this parameter, it will not cast if you are invisible. -kill Keep casting this spell until the target dies. -maxtries|\\<#> Cast the spell this many times until successful. -recast|\\<#> Recast the spell this many times. -setin| Same as bandolier \\(left here for backwards-compatibility purposes\\) . -targetid|\\<#> Target this ID before casting. Examples: /casting \"Wunshi's Focusing\" gem4 -invis /casting \"Complete Heal|gem1\" -kill -targetid|1234 /casting \"Fizzle a Lot|gem4\" -maxtries|5 /casting \"uber nuke|9\" -kill /casting \"cannibalize\" gem3 -recast|5 /interrupt \u00b6 This will just interrupt the current spell/item/AA that is casting. It's the same as doing /stopcast, or /dismount then /stopcast if you're mounted at the time. /memorize \u00b6 Syntax: /memorize \"name\" [gem] As with the /casting command above, the /memorize command can take spell names or IDs, and can use gem# or just the numbers themselves. The gem# or number can also be appended to the end of the name.

The /casting command requires only 1 argument, the name of the spell you wish to cast. If the spell is not memmed, it will try and mem it in gem5 \\(this is the default if no gem is specified\\) . If the spell has more than one word, make sure to surround it with quotes. For example: /casting \"Minor Shielding\" This will cast the Minor Shielding spell if it is already memmed, or if not, will attempt to memorize it in gem5 before casting. You can also include the gem number \\(or just the number\\) after the name of the spell, to indicate which gem it should be memmed into. For example: /casting \"Minor Shielding\" 1 /casting \"Minor Shielding\" gem1 These will both cast Minor Shielding if memmed, or memorize it in gem1 before casting. The gem number can also be appended to the end of the spell name, separated by a pipe command, like so: /casting \"Minor Shielding|gem1\" /casting \"Minor Shielding|1\" You can also use the ID of the spell you wish to mem/cast. The following 4 examples all do the same thing: /casting 288|gem1 /casting 288|1 /casting 288 gem1 /casting 288 1 All of the above will cast \"Minor Shielding\" \\(ID 288\\) and mem it in gem1 if not already memmed. When clicking items you use the same syntax, except the \"name\" of the spell is the name of the item or the item's ID. It's always recommended to specify the type as \"item\" or specify the slot name/slot ID if you are clicking an item. For example: /casting \"Fabled Journeyman's Boots\" item /casting 68239|item /casting \"Shrunken Goblin Skull Earring\" leftear Options: The following optional parameters can be added to the /casting line: -bandolier| Equip the bandolier with before casting. Useful for focus effects. -invis With this parameter, it will not cast if you are invisible. -kill Keep casting this spell until the target dies. -maxtries|\\<#> Cast the spell this many times until successful. -recast|\\<#> Recast the spell this many times. -setin| Same as bandolier \\(left here for backwards-compatibility purposes\\) . -targetid|\\<#> Target this ID before casting. Examples: /casting \"Wunshi's Focusing\" gem4 -invis /casting \"Complete Heal|gem1\" -kill -targetid|1234 /casting \"Fizzle a Lot|gem4\" -maxtries|5 /casting \"uber nuke|9\" -kill /casting \"cannibalize\" gem3 -recast|5","title":"/casting"},{"location":"plugins/community-plugins/mq2cast/#interrupt","text":"This will just interrupt the current spell/item/AA that is casting.

Supported Abilities \u00b6 Combat Abilities \u00b6 See MQ2Melee#Supported AA's, Combat Abilities, Skills & Spells by Class Alternate Advancement Abilities \u00b6 See MQ2Melee#Supported AA's, Combat Abilities, Skills & Spells by Class Melee Disciplines \u00b6 See MQ2Melee#Supported AA's, Combat Abilities, Skills & Spells by Class Detected Disciplines \u00b6 The following Disciplines are detected to promote some combat abilities: Ashenhand Discipline, Assassin Discipline \\(3\\) , Silentfist Discipline, and Thunderkick Discipline. Skills \u00b6 See MQ2Melee#Supported AA's, Combat Abilities, Skills & Spells by Class Spell Handling \u00b6 Provoke can be configured to cast any AA, disc or spell. It will auto-detect if you lose aggro, and then attempt to use any of the defined spells to regain it. To determine the proper Spell ID for any Discipline, Alternate Ability or Spell to be used with the provoke/stun commands use one of the following commands: For Disciplines use: /echo \\({Me.CombatAbility\\[\\) {Me.CombatAbility \\]} .ID} , replacing with the name of the Discipline. For AAs, use /aa info . The first number \\(before the AA name\\) is the Spell ID. For Spells, use /echo ${Spell[].ID} , replacing with the spell name. Alternatively, you can look on Lucy for the discipline/spell/AA and get the ID from there. Some common discipline IDs are listed below: Ancient Chaos Cry id=5016 Bazu Bellow id=6173 Bellow id=4681 Bellow of the Mastruq id=5015 Berate id=4682 Incite id=4697 Mock id=8467 Provoke id=4608 Crippling Strike id=468 Stuns can also be configured to cast any AA, disc or spells when MQ2Melee detects that your target begins to cast a spell. Provoke and Stun have built-in values, but they can always be overwritten using the command line (eg. **/melee provoke0=5015**) or by editing the** provoke0 setting in the INI file and then typing /melee reload** in game. Commands \u00b6 All options below are listed with on/off as the arguments used to enable/disable the option, however true or 1 can be used in place of on , and false or 0 can be used in place of off . Example: /melee on aggro=on taunt=on kick=1 bash=0 intimidation=false disarm=true /melee by itself will list all abilities and settings that are available to you. Some settings are dependant on others being active, so may not show up until you enable the prerequisite option. To find the relevant Item IDs for the various options, you can use the following command: /echo ${FindItem = .ID} , replacing with the name of the item you are looking for (no need to use quotes). Eg. /echo ${FindItem =Blade of Carnage .ID} results in \"25210\". /melee options \u00b6 on\\|off Turns plugin On/Off. aggro = on\\|off *Plugin tries to keep aggro on target using all enabled aggro abilities/disciplines until aggro is regained, or either you or the target dies.* aggropri = Item ID Item ID for primary weapon to be used in aggro mode. aggrosec = Item ID Item ID for secondary weapon to be used in aggro mode. arrow = Item ID Item ID of ammunition to use for ranged/throwing attacks. backoff = 0-100 *Turns attack off if your life percentage goes below the designated value.

Options that contain macro commands are set by editing the INI file and then loading the values with /melee load . \"IF\" Options \u00b6 The following \"IF\" options can be set in the INI file. They will then be evaluated before the relevant disc/skill is triggered. They all need to take the form of ${If _condition_,1,0 } statements and must return an integer. Any return of 0 is considered FALSE, any other integer is considered TRUE. Eg. \\({If\\[\\) ,1,0]} will always be evaluated correctly. Your defined condition must not exceed 255 characters, or it will cause the plugin to crash. backstabif bashif beggingif callchallengeif challengeforif commandingif cryhavocif disarmif dragonpunchif eaglestrikeif evadeif fallsif feralswipeif fistofwuif flyingkickif forageif frenzyif harmtouchif pothealfastif pothealoverif hideif intimidationif joltif kickif layhandif leopardclawif mendif pickpocketif provokeif ragevolleyif rakeif roundkickif sensetrapif slamif sneakif strikeif stunningif tauntif thiefeyeif throwstoneif tigerclawif twistedshankif Other Options \u00b6 stickcmd This command takes a list of options that should be passed to the /stick command. Eg. \"hold 15\" downshit0-downshit7 Each one of these takes a macro command that will be run when you are not in combat. Remember, you have to enable each option with /melee downflag#=on . holyshit0-holyshit7 Each one of these takes a macro command that will be run at the beginning of combat. Remember, you have to enable each option with /melee holyflag#=on . HolyShit and DownShit \u00b6 MQ2Melee now supports up to 20 macro command lines of each that will be executed when one of the following conditions are true: Holyshit: Commands will be executed when in combat, no casting going on and the cursor is free. Downshit: Commands will be executed when not in combat, not casting and the cursor is free. When setting these commands, you must be careful not to fall into an endless loop or create a spam war. Make sure that when your line finishes, it will set up something that will force it to be FALSE for a while! These Commands are turned on and off by downflagx and holyflagx if your downshit or holyshit parses ANY macro variables, you MUST set these flags to 2 instead of 1 INI File Examples \u00b6 Please Note: Use this section only for adding useful examples that can be included in the INI file, not for copy/pastes of the INI files themselves.

MQ2Melee uses default values for these parameters unless it finds a file named MQ2Melee.ini that you created in the same directory. Here is an example of a MQ2Melee.ini file and a description of the parameters: [Settings] SpawnType=10 MeleeKeys=z RangeKeys=x SpawnType : 0 + all desired target type modifier: \\(+1 PC\\) \\(+2 NPC\\) \\(+4 PC PET\\) \\(+8 NPC PET\\) \\(+16 PC CORPSE\\) (+32 NPC CORPSE) default is 10 \\(0 for base + 2 for NPC and + 8 for NPC PET\\) . MeleeKeys : Melee Attack Key \\(not same as eq please unless you like problems\\) default is z. RangeKeys : Range Attack Key default is x. Troubleshooting/FAQ \u00b6 I have made changes to my INI settings. How do I activate the new settings? If you have MQ2Melee loaded and use an editor to make changes to your INI file, use /melee load to reload your settings. Alternatively, you can unload and reload the plugin. I keep having to making changes to my melee settings from the command line. How do I save the new settings? From the command line type /melee save . I can't get the StickCmd to work With Version 4 of the MQ2Melee plugin there was a change to the StickCmd, wherein it no longer requires \"/stick\" in the parameters. The old format of \"StickCmd=/Stick hold 10 moveback\" thus becomes \"StickCmd=hold 10 moveback\". Also you will have to execute /melee stickmode=1 to tell the plugin to use stick arguments from ini and not built-in default /stick behaviour. **I get the message \"Exchange: -1 slot can not be Found\" or \"Item \"XYZ\" is not found\" for potion belt enabled items and using in downshit & holyshit command lines**. Use /potionbelt activate # Where as #=the potionbelt slot your item in \\(example for Haste potion that is in slot 2 of the potionbelt\\) downshit6=/if \\(${Spell\\[Elixir of Speed X\\].Stacks} && !${Me.Buff\\[Elixir of Speed X\\].ID} && !${Me.Moving}\\) /potionbelt activate 2","title":"MQ2Melee"},{"location":"plugins/community-plugins/mq2melee/#mq2melee","text":"","title":"MQ2Melee"},{"location":"plugins/community-plugins/mq2melee/#description","text":"MQ2Melee , written by s0rCieR, is designed to provide intelligent use of SHORT TIME REUSE MELEE ABILITIES and PET HANDLING during combat, depending on current combat conditions.

Compiling EQBCS \\(Windows\\) \u00b6 '''This guide for compiling EQBCS for Windows is credited to Tinydru from this post Copy the two parts of the eqbsc post in to a single eqbcs.cpp file (you can just use Notepad to do this - just \u00b6 remember to replace the .txt extension with .cpp). Launch Visual Studio 2005 Create a new project. For the project type, select Visual C++ | Win32 and then Win32 Console Application template. Name the project \\(I used eqbcs\\) . Make sure to pay attention as to where it is creating the directory for the project \\(so you know where to grab the app files after you build the solution\\) . Click the OK button after you've given it a name. Click the Next button on the first page of the Win32 Application Wizard On the Applications Settings window: Leave the default Application type as \"Console application\" Uncheck \"Precompiled header\" Check \"Empty project\" Click the Finish button Your empty project should now be open. In the Solution Explorer, right click on the \"Source Files\" folder and select Add -> Existing Item from the list. Navigate to the folder where you saved the eqbcs.cpp file you created in step 1 and double click on it \\(eqbcs.cpp\\) . This will add eqbcs.cpp to the Source Files folder. In the Solution Explorer, double click on the eqbcs.cpp file - this will open the code in the code window. In the code, find \"tempPort = atoi \\(argv\\[1\\]\\) ;\" and replace it with \"tempPort = atoi \\(\\(const char \\*\\) argv 1 );\" \\(this will be on or near line 1983\\) . Thanks much to Bardomatic for fixing this piece of code. From the File menu, select Save All. From the Build menu, select \"Configuration Manager...\" In the Active solution configuration: drop down box, select \"Release\" and then click the Close button. From the Project menu, select eqbcs Properties... (\"eqbcs\" might be diffent if you named the project something else). In the Configuration: drop down at the top of the Property Pages window, select \"Release\" from the list. Open the Configuration Properties node \\(click on the little +\\) and then the Linker node. Now click on \"Input\" (found beneath \"Linker\"). In the right hand window of the Propery Pages window, click on \"Additional Dependencies\". When you click on that, a little box with elipses \\(...\\) will appear on the right side of the field - click on that. The Additional Dependencies window will open. Type wsock32.lib in the text box and then click the OK button. Click the OK button on the Property Pages window. From the File menu, select Save All. From the Build menu, select Build solution. The build *should* succeed. You are done - go get your new eqbcs.exe from the Release folder where you created the solution!!

The discussion thread for this application is found in the VIP forums here . The most recent release of this application also allows you to view detailed information about characters connected to your server by selecting their name, which will display their statistics on the right-hand side of EQBC Interface. The interval of how often to poll the selected character is configurable by the user so that this information can be very close to real-time.

Author: Omnictrl \\(o\\) Contributor: ascii38 \\(a\\) Contributor: Vladus2000 \\(v\\) Contributor: pms \\(p\\) Contributor: ieatacid \\(i\\) Contributor: three-p-o Contributor: MacQ Contributor: Jimbob == MQ2EQBC == Version 12.1 \u00b6 Update by Jimbob I added support for my latest eqbci release, so it will provide more information to the client. Version 12.0 \u00b6 Update by MacQ I modified the LoadINI() section to first load from the Settings section of the INI, then it loads from the SERVER.CHARACTER section. If there is no SERVER.CHARACTER section or one of the variables is not listed in the SERVER.CHARACTER section, then the value of that variable defaults to the Settings section or the defaults originally hard coded in EQBC. With this technique, we have greater flexibility to control variables on either a global or per characters basis. Now you can set certain variables you deem to be more global in the Settings section, or variables you deem to be more character specific set in a SERVER.CHARACTER section, which will override the Settings section. Version 11.0219 \u00b6 Update by three-p-o Update for GetTickCount64 Version 11.0218 \u00b6 Fix for null pointer crash when logging in \\(final pms update\\) Version 10.0513 \u00b6 Death to Diversity. \\(Constant to prevent win7 64bit crashes\\) Version 9.0904 \u00b6 Item links now function in the custom window \\(thanks dkaa, ieatacid\\) Added a new option 'echoall' - /bccmd set echoall on This will echo outgoing '/bca' commands back to you in this format: \\(to all\\) message or command here This defaults to off. Version 9.0822 \u00b6 New Features /bccmd iniconnect -- you can now save regularly used servers to your ini and connect to them by the key name in the event you have your own server, and a few others for your mates. Example, in your ini you could do [Mine] Server=127.0.0.1 Port=9999 [MyServer] Server=10.0.0.10 Port=1234 [Sklug] Server=soe.sony.com Port=1337 [Ngreth] Server=soe.sony.com Port=7331 and then /bccmd iniconnect mine or /bccmd iniconnect myserver and so on... /bccmd forceconnect -- will disconnect you from your current server and attempt to connect to the new one rather than warn you that you are already connected and do nothing. New Settings \\(see the functionality changes about the syntax\\) silentinccmd -- if you trust those you botchat with and do not want to see incoming command requests, enabling this option will squelch all command requests silentoutmsg -- this happens with compatmode off, but if you turn compatmode on \\( >name\\< looks weird!\\) and want to hide the outgoing messages, you may enable this and it will keep the names irc-leet and still squelch the message notifycontrol -- with the allow control option disabled, enabling notifycontrol will output a message to /bc notifying that the command request was not processed due to allow control being off. \\(/bcaa //bc test ...\\) The dedicated UI window now allows for a keybind. Pressing the keybind will set the cursor focus on the bc window (which, for those who do not know, anything you type there defaults to /bc, so you do not need to prefix the msg if you do not want). -The keybind defaults to nothing -It saves to MacroQuest.ini as \"EQBC_Nrm=clear\" when you first load the plugin. You may adjust it in Settings Keybind=key of your EQBC ini file \\(i do it there\\) before loading the plugin. New TLO members string \\({EQBC.Server} - OFFLINE if not connected, the name of the server \\(hostname or ip depending on how you made the connection\\) if connected -- /if \\(\\) {EQBC.Server.Equal 127.0.0.1 }) { // do my private stuff } else { // do other stuff } string ${EQBC.Port} - OFFLINE if not connected, the port number otherwise string \\({EQBC.ToonName} - the name of your character _AS SEEN BY EQBC_ aka /if \\(\\) {EQBC.ToonName.Equal YouPlayer }) { // im bugged or have a ghost, so do my fix routine } bool \\({EQBC.Setting\\[\\[i\\]settingname\\[/i\\]\\]} - returns the TRUE or FALSE based on if a setting is enabled. the form is required, so if you do not supply a \\[i\\]settingname\\[/i\\] it will return FALSE. -- /if \\(\\) {EQBC.Setting tellwatch }) { /echo I have tellwatch enabled } Functionality Changes the syntax of all the settings has changed slightly. sorry for the annoyance but it had to be done... you now adjust the settings either with 'set __ on/off' or 'toggle ___' so previously: /bccmd toggletellwatch now becomes /bccmd toggle tellwatch or /bccmd set tellwatch on or /bccmd set tellwatch off this applies to all setting options. /bccmd set reconnectsecs # <---this is the only one that does not support on/off, and the only that accepts a number as a parameter as seen in the source, valid settings are: autoconnect control compatmode reconnect window reconnectsecs localecho tellwatch guildwatch groupwatch fswatch silentcmd savebychar silentinccmd notifycontrol silentoutmsg Rather than pretend it will be fixed again one day, removed the 'relog' command parameter (and all related functions) as MQ2SwitchChar by ieatacid provides all the functionality needed. when offline, /bcaa will no longer announce the 'you are not connected' error message followed by processing the command locally regardless. Cleanup & Bug Fixes The dedicated UI window will no longer clear previous buffer when zoning in some cases The dedicated UI window will now remain when hovering. The dedicated UI window will no longer set the cursor at the beginning of the line when scrolling through the command history. The dedicated UI window history will no longer scroll through the history out of order in some cases. The dedicated UI window should now properly update the window title when reconnecting to a different server (unless you set UseMyTitle=1) The dedicated UI window should save your title for you instead of requiring a manual entry to the INI Camping out should properly save your window settings \\(probably not CTD or /exit\\) without forcing you to toggle the window on & off to force a save The dedicated UI window will no longer display item links as long strings of item data. They will properly display with their pink clickable names. FOR NOW THE LINKS DO NOT FUNCTION , I have a feeling due to buffer size & MAX_STRING not being big enough in other places, so it may be fixable in the future but no promises. ___watch features no longer output the weird characters in the name. \\(thanks ieatacid for donating this logic\\) fswatch no longer relays your own output \\(\"You tell your fellowship\"\\) Using '/camp server' will now properly disconnect you instead of leaving a ghost toon connected (previously stayed until exit eqgame, or reconnect to char select) --- WTB '#define GAMESTATE_SERVERSELECT -1', pst with price Logging into eqbcs via EQBC Interface with a ridiculously large username will no longer cause the eqbc client to crash from buffer overflows. The welcome to EQBC message now properly displays upon first entry \\(of the session\\) into the world rather than only displaying if you loaded the plugin after you were in game, without a dedicated UI window.

Cleanup & Bug Fixes The dedicated UI window will no longer clear previous buffer when zoning in some cases The dedicated UI window will now remain when hovering. The dedicated UI window will no longer set the cursor at the beginning of the line when scrolling through the command history. The dedicated UI window history will no longer scroll through the history out of order in some cases. The dedicated UI window should now properly update the window title when reconnecting to a different server (unless you set UseMyTitle=1) The dedicated UI window should save your title for you instead of requiring a manual entry to the INI Camping out should properly save your window settings \\(probably not CTD or /exit\\) without forcing you to toggle the window on & off to force a save The dedicated UI window will no longer display item links as long strings of item data. They will properly display with their pink clickable names. FOR NOW THE LINKS DO NOT FUNCTION , I have a feeling due to buffer size & MAX_STRING not being big enough in other places, so it may be fixable in the future but no promises. ___watch features no longer output the weird characters in the name. \\(thanks ieatacid for donating this logic\\) fswatch no longer relays your own output \\(\"You tell your fellowship\"\\) Using '/camp server' will now properly disconnect you instead of leaving a ghost toon connected (previously stayed until exit eqgame, or reconnect to char select) --- WTB '#define GAMESTATE_SERVERSELECT -1', pst with price Logging into eqbcs via EQBC Interface with a ridiculously large username will no longer cause the eqbc client to crash from buffer overflows.

The original goal behind this rewrite was to cleanup numerous logical errors and reduce the amount of code duplication that existed in previous releases. Once this rewrite was complete and functional, version 9 expanded including more enhancements and more extensive configuration. Numbered by release date, the current of this plugin is 16.0717. This plugin is no longer under active development and no new contributions have been made since 2011 by pms, with only one follow-up contribution in 2014 by Cr4zyb4rd.

There are many different parameters that cause this command to behave in different ways. You can combine any number of these parameters together inline to enable multiple options for the stick. * '''/stick stick with no parameters will stick you to your current target, using max melee range * /stick on | off turns stick on and off with default values on is a nearly-useless parameter and only included to support older macros or stickcmd=on in MQ2Melee to prevent MQ2Melee from doing anything undesired if you use /stick on in your macro, expect to be laughed at whole-heartedly * /stick id \\# sticks to the given spawn id uses id of your current target if no spawn id is given this allows you to continue sticking when your target changes, e.g. casting a heal on someone * /stick # | #% Stick at the specified distance or percentage * /stick -# Reduce current stick distance modifier by # * /stick moveback stick will back up to the value if the target gets closer, e.g. many targets in the rear pushing target too close to the tank * /stick loose stick using turn increments instead of instant heading adjustment * /stick truehead stick using actual keypress heading adjustments does not work if wineq option is enabled * /stick healer Healer sticking does not perform face adjustments to look at the target while in stick range This is good for keeping a healer close & sticking to another group member without having it turn to face the other character constantly as it moves Does not work with any strafe-style sticks \\(pin front !front behind behindonce snaproll\\) * /stick uw | underwater face angle will look up/down at the stick target * /stick hold stick to the current target even if your target changes * /stick behind stick to the rear of the target unless you are on HoTT. will spin in circles if you do not have HoTT and gain aggro \\(to prevent: USE DelayStrafe OPTION !!!\\) * /stick behindonce stick behind the target when first moving into position, only using enforcement after * /stick !front stick to target anywhere but the frontal arc, same considerations as behind apply \\(use DelayStrafe!\\) * /stick pin stick to the side of the target, same consideration as behind apply \\(use DelayStrafe!\\) * /stick front stick to the front arc of the target if you have HoTT and lose aggro you will not spin this will not work by default without HoTT * /stick \\(ANY STICK VALUES\\) always when current target is lost, will wait and then resume sticking using supplied values upon next NPC targeted does not work with stick hold or stick id * /stick snaproll ** **left** **\\|** **right** **\\|** **face** **\\|** **rear** ** runs in a straight line behind your target then turns to face left/right/front of target if optional parameter direction supplied rear is default ''the following inline configuration options are supported for one-time use: **/stick breakontarget | breakongate | breakonwarp | pauseonwarp | randomize | delaystrafe | useback | usefleeing | strafewalk | mindelay # | maxdelay # | backupdist # | breakdist # | snapdist # | !frontarc # | behindarc # </span>** Read the _set name _section for explanation of what these parameters do * /stick mod # | -# modify stick distance by the supplied amount \\(does not turn stick on\\) === /moveto === The moveto command will move you from your current location to a specific location or target.

The older system has not been removed - if this is difficult to understand you may still use verbosity , fullverbosity and totalsilence as before. For those familiar with bit flags the flags table is below. If you have never worked with bit flags before, here is a brief summary of how to use the information below. Each subset of messages is assigned a numerical value. By adding the numerical values of the messages you want on together, you are able to customize each message that is shown or not shown. Examples: If you only wanted the plugin to display 'settings' and 'errors', you would look at the value of settings in the table below \\(8192\\) and the value of errors \\(4194304\\) and add them together to get \\(4202496\\) . By setting your verbosity flag to 4202496 \\(using the _set verbflags_ parameter or by saving the value in the INI file\\) the plugin would then filter out everything except messages related to changing settings or error messages.

The older system has not been removed - if this is difficult to understand you may still use verbosity , fullverbosity and totalsilence as before. For those familiar with bit flags the flags table is below. If you have never worked with bit flags before, here is a brief summary of how to use the information below. Each subset of messages is assigned a numerical value. By adding the numerical values of the messages you want on together, you are able to customize each message that is shown or not shown. Examples: If you only wanted the plugin to display 'settings' and 'errors', you would look at the value of settings in the table below \\(8192\\) and the value of errors \\(4194304\\) and add them together to get \\(4202496\\) . By setting your verbosity flag to 4202496 \\(using the _set verbflags_ parameter or by saving the value in the INI file\\) the plugin would then filter out everything except messages related to changing settings or error messages. If you only wanted to display 'stick verbosity' messages and nothing else, you would look up the value in the table below \\(32\\) and set your flags to 32 without adding anything to it. If you want to display a large number of messages, you continue to add them all together and use the total. To display 'autopause', 'movepause', 'stick verbosity', 'stick fullverbosity', 'settings' and 'errors', you would add all their values from the below table \\(1 + 2 + 32 + 64 + 8192 + 4194304 = 4202595\\) and use that number for your flags setting \\(/stick set verbflags 4202595\\)","title":"Defaults"},{"location":"plugins/community-plugins/mq2moveutils/#flags-table","text":"0 - total plugin silence 1 - autopause 2 - movepause, mousepause, breakonkb 4 - breakonmouse 8 - feign support 16 - hidehelp 32 - stick verbosity 64 - stick full verbosity 128 - moveto verbosity 256 - moveto full verbosity 512 - makecamp verbosity 1024 - makecamp full verbosity 2048 - circle verbosity 4096 - circle full verbosity 8192 - settings 16384 - file input / output 32768 - breakonwarp 65536 - breakonaggro 131072 - breakonhit 262144 - breakonsummon 524288 - breakongm 1048576 - breakongate 2097152 - stick always 4194304 - error messages 8388608 - arc randomization 16777216 - pause / unpause 2720 - prior 'verbosity' setting 11736390 - prior 'fullverbosity' setting 33554431 - all messages enabled","title":"Flags Table"},{"location":"plugins/community-plugins/mq2moveutils/#actual-messages","text":"Here is a list of exactly what messages are tied to each flag: 1 - autopause AutoPause halting movement... \\(when autopaused if autopause is enabled\\) Movement pausing due to self target... \\(if self targeted during a stick with autopause off\\) 2 - movepause, mousepause, breakonkb Current command ended from manual movement.

See: Original MQ2MoveUtils Discussion History The conception of this plugin was inspired by the /circle command, developed by Easar to be included in the earliest versions of MQ2Twist . For all intents and purposes Easar should be considered the inspiration for this entire project. See: Easar's contribution to MQ2Twist / MQ2Twister \\(abandoned\\) tonio did an amazing job enhancing the early versions of this plugin with features including: breaking from mob gate, breaking from mob warp with distance configuration, autopause to prevent casting interrupts, stick behind, stick id, mpause, stick loose, and stick hold Contributors to the enhancement of MQ2MoveUtils after tonio stopped supporting it include: Bombadil \\(_Binds for mpause_\\) , onetimehero \\(_noface option_\\) , Lax, Cr4zyb4rd \\(_TLO's & /stick pin_\\) , and rswiders \\(_/moveto_\\) Quagmire offered full support for the plugin for a brief period in 2005, adding many bug fixes, code cleanup, and features such as: /stick behindonce, walk/run switching, mount checking, and snare checking.

See: Outlander's MoveUtils Outlander's first big contributions to MQ2MoveUtils were his stuck logic, which started off as an include file , and the /makecamp command, which created a radius that you could use to prevent your character from moving out of range to chase down mobs or potentially gain unwanted aggro.

The information below applies to the 7.0518 and earlier versions of MQ2MoveUtils. MQ2MoveUtils is a very popular plugin which assists with most aspects of moving around within EQ. It has been worked on by a number of developers over the years \\(tonio, CyberTech, Quagmire and Outlander\\) . For the history of this plugin and development notes please see MQ2MoveUtils:History . The old forum thread for MQ2MoveUtils can be found here , in the VIP forums. Source for the version 7.0 MQ2MoveUtils is available. Features \u00b6 The main features of MQ2MoveUtils are as follows: Stick: This is the main use for this plugin and allows you to \"stick\" a certain distance from your target. It can be set to always stick behind the target, or always in front if you're tanking. MoveTo: Move to a certain point or target. This has some built-in logic that will allow it to move around obstacles. MakeCamp: You can set a spot as a \"camp\", so that you can return to it if you get too far away, or after combat, etc. Circle: Run in a circle. Commands \u00b6 /stick \u00b6 /stick on\\|off Turn stick on and off. The default for /stick is to stick at max melee range. /stick hold Sticks to current target even if you lose/change target /stick [] Stick at units to your target /stick - Subtract the dist used from the current stick distance \\(ie. it will put you units closer to your target\\) /stick % Stick at of max melee range from target. Eg. if max melee range is 20, then /stick 50% will stick you at 10 range /stick behind Sticks you behind your target. *Note: Be careful with this option if you do not have the Health of Target's Target Leadership Ability. If you have HoTT active and you are the Target of your Target, then you will not try to get behind. However if you do not have this ability and you gain aggro, you will spin around very quickly as you try and get behind your target while it continues to face you.* /stick behindonce Get behind the target once then convert to a regular stick /stick pin Sticks you to the side of the target, same considerations as /stick behind apply /stick !front Sticks you anywhere but in front of the target, will only reposition you if you would be in front. Same considerations apply to this as the \"behind\" and \"pin\" options /stick moveback Moveback will back your toon up to the current value, keeping you at a consistant distance from your target /stick loose Uses a time delay so adjustments to your position do not occur as frequently, simulating a more human-like control /stick uw This changes the facing of your toon, and is very useful under water, where you will try and follow the Z coordinate of the spawn you are facing /stick id Allows you to stick to a specific spawn ID /stick mpause By enabling mpause, manually moving your toon will not break stick and will rather put it on hold. When you are done manually moving, the /stick command will once again kick in and you will continue following the same target as before /stick pause\\|unpause Pause and unpause the stick command /stick save\\|load Some settings are stored in the INI file. This allows you to save your current preferences to the INI file, or load the saved preferences this file /stick mindelay When used with /stick this delay is used when mpause is enabled to decide the smallest value to use to resume the /stick command after a manual move /stick maxdelay When used with /stick this delay is used when mpause is enabled to decide the largest value to use to resume the /stick command after a manual move /moveto \u00b6 /moveto loc Y X\\|off Moves you to the specified location, or stops the current /moveto \\(by using \"/moveto off\"\\) /moveto [] Sets the maximum distance from your moveto point that you consider acceptable. This option is here because it's not always possible to move to the exact point that you specify, so the plugin will move you to within units of the moveto point before stopping. Eg. if you use \"/moveto 5\", you will always move to within 5 units from your moveto point /moveto - Subtract from the current moveto distance /moveto mpause By enabling mpause, manually moving your toon will not break moveto and will rather put it on hold. When you are done manually moving, the /moveto command will once again kick in and you will continue moving to your moveto point /moveto pause\\|unpause Pause and unpause the moveto command /moveto ID Spawn ID Moves to the specified Spawn ID or moves to your current target if no Spawn ID is provided /moveto mindelay When used with /moveto this delay is used when mpause is enabled to decide the smallest value to use to resume the /moveto command after a manual move. /moveto maxdelay When used with /moveto this delay is used when mpause is enabled to decide the largest value to use to resume the /moveto command after a manual move. /moveto save\\|load Save or load the moveto settings /makecamp \u00b6 /makecamp on\\|off Turns MakeCamp logic off or turns it on, using your current location as the anchor point /makecamp Turns MakeCamp logic on using the supplied Y,X location as the camp anchor point /makecamp mindelay If outside the MakeCamp radius this is the minimum delay used before returning to a point within the camp radius /makecamp maxdelay If outside the MakeCamp radius this is the maxium delay used before returning to a point within the camp radius /makecamp leash Toggle the leash logic on and off. Leash is the maximum distance away from your camp anchor your toon will be allowed to go using another MQ2MoveUtils command such as /stick /makecamp leash Turns leash logic ON and sets the leash length /makecamp radius Sets the camp radius. This is the maximum distance you can be from the anchor point and still be considered \"in camp\" /makecamp mpause By enabling mpause, manually moving your toon will not break makecamp and will rather put it on hold. When you are done manually moving, the /makecamp command will once again kick /makecamp pause\\|unpause Pause and unpause the MQ2MoveUtils makecamp functionality /makecamp return Returns your toon to the camp immediatly /makecamp save\\|load Save or load the makecamp settings /circle \u00b6 /circle on\\|off Sets the anchor point to your current location, and uses the currently set radius /circle on Sets the anchor point to your current location, and uses the specified /circle Sets Y,X anchor point around which to circle /circle mpause By enabling mpause manually moving your toon will not break the circle but will instead put it on hold, when you get done manually moving the toon the /circle command will once again kick in. /circle pause\\|unpause Pause and unpause the /circle command /circle drunken Does not move in a perfect circle but instead the circle is more human-like /circle mindelay When used with /circle this delay is used when mpause is enabled to decide the smallest value to use to resume the /stick command after a manual move. /circle maxdelay When used with /circle this delay is used when mpause is enabled to decide the largest value to use to resume the /stick command after a manual move. /circle save\\|load Save or load the circle settings from the INI file Top-Level Objects \u00b6 Stick \u00b6 string ${Stick} Same as ${Stick.Status} \\(see below\\) . string ${Stick.Status} Return ON if currently sticking, OFF if not, or PAUSED if it is paused bool ${Stick.Active} Returns TRUE if currently sticking, FALSE if not bool ${Stick.Behind} Returns TRUE if behind target float ${Stick.Distance} The current stick distance bool ${Stick.Loose} Returns TRUE if stick loose is set bool ${Stick.MoveBack} Returns TRUE if stick is set to moveback bool ${Stick.MoveBehind} Returns TRUE if stick is set to move behind the target bool ${Stick.MovePause} Returns TRUE if stick movement is paused due to manual intervention bool ${Stick.Paused} Returns TRUE if stick has been paused with \"/stick pause\" bool ${Stick.Pin} Returns TRUE if /stick pin is being used bool ${Stick.Stopped} Returns TRUE if you are stationary MoveTo \u00b6 string ${MoveTo} Return ON if currently moving to a location, OFF if not, or PAUSED if it is paused bool ${MoveTo.Moving} Returns TRUE if moving to location, FALSE if not bool ${MoveTo.Stopped} Returns TRUE if stopped, FALSE if not MakeCamp \u00b6 string ${MakeCamp} Same as ${MakeCamp.Status} \\(see below\\) . string ${MakeCamp.Status} Return ON if MakeCamp is enabled, OFF if it is not enabled or PAUSED if it is paused float ${MakeCamp.AnchorX} The X Loc of the anchor point float ${MakeCamp.AnchorY} The Y Loc of the anchor point float ${MakeCamp.CampRadius} The current camp radius bool ${MakeCamp.Leash} Returns TRUE if the leash is enabled, FALSE if not float ${MakeCamp.LeashLength} The length of the leash int ${MakeCamp.MaxDelay} The maximum delay before resuming /makecamp functionality after manual intervention int ${MakeCamp.MinDelay} The minimum delay before resuming /makecamp functionality after manual intervention bool ${MakeCamp.Returning} Returns TRUE if returning to camp, FALSE if not INI File \u00b6 A default INI file is created \\(if it doesn't exist\\) when you issue one of the \"save\" commands \\(eg. /stick save, /moveto save, etc\\) . The Defaults section contains global defaults for all users. New sections can be added with character names as titles to override the default values. An example INI file is below, with explanations of the options underneath: [Defaults] AutoPause=on BreakOnWarp=on BreakDist=250.0 BreakOnGate=on Verbosity=1 ManualPause=on MinDelay=500 MaxDelay=5000 CampRadius=0.0 LeashLength=0.0 StuckLogic=on stuckCheck=5 stuckDist=0.1 AutoPause on/off This enables or disables the automatic pause on cast feature. This does not apply to bards, since they can move while singing. BreakOnWarp on/off With BreakOnWarp on, any movement will be terminated if the target moves too far away. See BreakDist to set the distance. BreakDist This sets how far away the target has to be before it will be considered too far away to continue following. BreakOnGate on/off This enables/disables monitoring chat for \" TargetName Gates\". Movement will be terminated if it determines that the target has gated. ManualPause on/off Stores your preference for the mPause functionality built into the various commands. MinDelay and MaxDelay Stores your preference for the resuming after manual move. These values are also used to return to camp at the end of a /stick or /moveto command when using /makecamp. CampRadius This is the default value used for /makecamp radius. LeashLength This is the default value used for /makecamp leash length StuckLogic on/off Enable or disable the logic used to determine if you are stuck behind an object when using /stick or /moveto. stickCheck The number of pulses that are averaged out to come up with the stuckDist comparison number. stuckDist This is the average distance covered during the the last stickCheck pulses to use as a comparison.

Your character spins in circles while jumping up and down \u00b6 You are likely using wineq2 while trying to use true movement. set wineq support on Otherwise, your framerate is really, really bad and you need to adjust your stucklogic settings by a very large amount OR, see the AdvPath comment below Common Issues with MQ2AdvPath and ModBot ala Master Kroak \u00b6 it was \"stuck\" i.e. turning and jumping. That's the plugin trying to get to the point your leader was at when the follow command was actually started.. It doesn't work like this plugin, ie - you get stuck behind a wall, leader moves back and you unstick.. It won't do that if it's last recorded follow point is past the wall... You have to turn off following to get a new follow path. After issuing the /bc follow, with an ini setting of /stick 20 hold uw, the bots will follow, but every 2-3 secs, they \"adjust\" trying to move forward a bit or something, even though their distance is less than 20, and the master isn't even moving. This happens if you have DoSit on and using AdvPath plugin to follow. Your stick setting is not used, and MQ2AdvPath has no setting to change it's follow distance. Not sure why MQ2Advpath is coded this way, but it will force your toon to stand if your distance is over 10 from your leader... The modbot macro is just trying to force your position so it's possible to sit without standing back up every second or so.. I'll increase the delay that's used there, and see if I can make one smooth movement.. P.S. If you WANT to use this plugin and not MQ2AdvPath for following, either unload MQ2AdvPath, or change this line at the top of modbot.mac to FALSE. /declare AdvPlug bool outer TRUE Your character looks straight up or down when underwater \u00b6 This happens from having the autouw feature enabled and sticking from a great distance. StuckLogic sucks underwater \u00b6 Yes, this is true. Do not attempt to stick from large distances while underwater unless you have a clear path. Water swimming motion is not easily measured like walk/run on dry land. You cannot manually break from a stick \u00b6 You use MQ2Melee You will need to enable breakonkb in MoveUtils and also set stickbreak=1 in MQ2Melee You do not use MQ2Melee You will need to enable breakonkb in MoveUtils. You use MQ2Melee and any time you issue a /stick with hotkey or macro, it gets changed \u00b6 This happens from not having 'stickcmd' set to anything in MQ2Melee while still having MQ2Melee set to use a stickrange it will use its own default parameters. You setup a camp but have problems returning to it \u00b6 The most common cause of this is having a target. By default, automatic camp returns require nothing on target. Verify what camp settings you have enabled. Certain features behave different ways, for example ReturnNoAggro will only return to the camp if you do not have aggro. ReturnHaveTarget will allow you to return even if you have a target. ReturnNotLooting will not return if you have an open corpse being looted. /stick front does not work \u00b6 You do not have HoTT data available. You either need the HoTT group leader AA or you need to enable nohottfront \\(_/stick set nohottfront on_\\) Your /face commands are not working \u00b6 You cannot use /face while a MoveUtils command is active. MoveUtils handles facing targets internally based on many different settings. Using /face in your macros that rely on MoveUtils is a bad practice that causes nothing but problems and thus is no longer allowed by the plugin. NONE of your commands are working but you are sure the plugin is loaded and was working for a bit \u00b6 Try \\( _/stick imsafe_ \\) if you have BreakOnSummon or BreakOnGM enabled Try \\( _/stick unpause_ \\) if you have PauseLock enabled Configuration \u00b6 What are the different ways to handle manual keyboard and mouse movement ? \u00b6 Breaking \\(_/stick set \\[breakonkb \\| breakonmouse\\] on_\\) BreakOnKB - if you touch any keyboard movement related key (forward, backward, left, right, strafeleft, straferight, autorun) the current command will end BreakOnMouse - if you use mouselook \\(default is hold right-click\\) , the current command will end Pausing \\(_/stick set \\[mpause \\| mousepause\\] on_\\) mpause - if you touch any keyboard movement key, the current command will pause to let you move and then resume after a configurable delay mousepause - if you use mouselook, the current command will resume after a configurable delay You may only have a Break or a Pause on for a single option, but not both. However, you may have a pause for one option and a break for a different option on. That is: Keyboard can either be breakonkb or mpause, and mouse can either be breakonmouse or mousepause, but you may not have breakonkb AND mpause Thus, you may have breakonkb and mousepause or mpause and breakonmouse. Results: MoveUtils: mpause on - pressing a movement key pauses stick for a defined amount of time (resume timer starts when all movement keys have been let go) breakonkb on - pressing a movement key breaks stick entirely both off - stick will not break from movement key input (i.e. it will fight you to stay locked onto target) MoveUtils with MQ2Melee mpause on - pressing a movement key pauses stick for a defined amount of time (resume timer starts when all movement keys have been let go) breakonkb on - pressing a movement key breaks stick entirely. MQ2Melee then turns it back on instantly if MQ2Melee's attack is on and you are within MQ2Melee's stickrange of the target. both off - stick will not break from movement key input, MQ2Melee's attack key will toggle stick state How do I make the plugin output less or more ChatWnd messages \u00b6 See the Verbosity section at the bottom of the main article. Movement & Heading \u00b6 What is the difference between fast, loose, and true heading? \u00b6 The three types of heading changes are a question of legitimacy versus efficiency. Fast heading instantly changes your heading to the desired location. If you are facing North, target a mob that is South of you, and issued a stick command with fast heading enabled, your character would instantly face the mob and begin running. This works like MQ2's /face command with the fast parameter. Repeated fast turns can be quite noticeable to other players and thus, the other options exist. Loose heading rotates your heading changes using a fixed size turn increment to look more legitimate. You are able to set this increment size between 1 and 100. These numbers represent the actual number of degrees you will turn per pulse, not any sort of scaling system. True heading rotates your heading changes using the same method EQ does if you were to hold down the right or left key. This is comparable to /keypress with right hold as parameters. This is the most legitimate method of turning available. It is also the slowest. Why do I move backwards often? It looks crazy and unnatural. \u00b6 Either your _backupdist' is set way too high \\(10.0 is reasonable, 50.0 is not\\) or you should just disable_useback'' When using loose or true heading, my character orbits around the destination/target rather than arriving smoothly \u00b6 This happens due to bad frame rate and you should tighten up the AllowMove setting. Default is 32.0, you can lower it down to 16.0 or even 8.0 When I dismount, my characters appear to be spinning in circles \u00b6 This is an EQ bug and has nothing to do with MQ2 nor MoveUtils == StuckLogic == What is stucklogic? \u00b6 When a character runs into an object, it will continue running forward because there is no awareness that the object exists. People with stucklogic disabled can often be seen running into walls or rocks or failing to navigate through twists and turns of tight areas \\(smart ones use AdvPath\\) . Stucklogic is an effort to overcome this problem by measuring an average distance moved per pulse based on Y X location. When the average distance declines dramatically, the plugin is able to be aware that forward motion is no longer happening and attempts to correct this. Explain what stucklogic values do \u00b6 TryToJump - will jump every few pulses to attempt scaling over small rocks and stumps \\(very helpful to **food races** such as gnomes that frequently get stuck\\) TurnHalf - if stucklogic has turned half way around \\(256 deg\\) without making any progress, it will reset heading to the starting point and try turning the other direction /stick set pulsecheck # -pulsecheck defaults to 4 -this value is sort of what \"stuckcheck\" was before. -it serves as the size of your pulse history to be used to calculate your average movement distance. the largest you can set this value to is 32 (defined by MAXRINGSIZE). The higher you set this number, the less often stucklogic would misfire (so if you are getting the \"jittery\" problem you will want to increase this value). This also means it will take longer to know that it is stuck, so if you are getting stuck and not responding fast enough, you would do the opposite and lower this value. /stick set pulseunstuck # -pulseunstuck defaults to 5 -this value is new -this is the amount of pulses you have successfully moved forward before hard-forcing stucklogic to be considered unstuck. this serves the purpose in that if you were stuck for 20 pulses, your stuck counter would normally try to move forward for 20 more pulses before considering itself free. there was some handling for this that had some issues so now you can set a value such as this one to force a faster \"im unstuck\" process. -the higher your framerate, the higher you want this value. 5 may not be enough on better computers and you may end up getting restuck again, it will look like what we are calling \"snaking\". If you notice yourself \"snaking\" then this would be the first value to try increasing. /stick set diststuck #.## -diststuck defaults to 0.5 -this is similar to before in that it is the amount of distance you need to have moved versus your average pulse rate in order to not be stuck -this value should properly scale for all speeds of computers. you may want to set it higher or lower, play with it and find what works best (and please let us know!!), but keep in mind setting this value to something tiny such as 0.001 as we did in the old logic should no longer be necessary. deadchicken has determined that mindset was only working because of some incorrect math in the formulas. try to stick with more logical values and then reporting back your results would be appreciated. I am in a boxed room with only a single doorway and stucklogic wont get me out \u00b6 It can eventually with turnhalf off, but it will take hours. Use MQ2AdvPath or a combination of /moveto loc Y X to get out of rooms like this. Stucklogic is helpful but it doesn't create miracles. Stick \u00b6 When I gain aggro, my character spins in circles \u00b6 You do not have access to the HoTT group leader AA while using /stick behind/!front/pin You can correct this by enabling DelayStrafe with a minimum value of at least 1500 before strafing When I lose aggro, my character spins in circles \u00b6 You do not have access to the HoTT group leader AA while using /stick front You can correct this by enabling DelayStrafe with a minimum value of at least 15000 before strafing You can also /stick set nohottfront off and stick front will be disabled if you do not have HoTT data When using MQ2Melee, I have to clear my target to stop sticking because turning off attack does not work \u00b6 You need to create a MQ2Melee attack hotkey and NOT USE the eq attack on/off key. They are not the same thing. My character stays at a fixed range when sticking even though I try to move closer manually \u00b6 This is due to moveback repositioning. Take that parameter out of your stick command. What is a snaproll? \u00b6 Basically if you issue /stick snaproll it will plot the movement location as an X behind the mob. No matter where you are relative to the mob, it will turn to face directly at the X and then run there in a straight line. If you issue /stick snaproll face the X is plotted in front of the mob. /stick snaproll left and it will go to your left aka the mob's right shoulder, and /stick snaproll right and it will go to the mob's left shoulder. This is mainly for hidden rogues to use their opening strike disc without strafing into position to maximize DPS. MakeCamp \u00b6 What is camp scattering and how do you use it? \u00b6 This is a bit complex but when configured properly it is amazing. The idea behind this is that instead of returning to a random location within your camp radius, you can define a specific bearing, distance, and scatter radius from the center of your camp. This way you could configure your characters to return to specified areas all the time. The INI supports values on a character by character basis as well, so you could configure your tank to return to the center, your casters to return behind the tank, and your melee to return to the sides of the tank. MoveTo \u00b6 I am rotating in place when i use /moveto y x z \u00b6 You supplied an unreachable Z axis destination. Either use /moveto y x, or supply an accurate z destination that can be reached Moveto never arrives at a destination, even ignoring z parameter \u00b6 Your arrival distance is set too low. 5.0 is the absolute minimum but 10.0 is recommended. Circle \u00b6 What is this command for? \u00b6 Bard circle kiting. Calc Angle \u00b6 What does any of this mean? \u00b6 Angular Dist - what moveutils uses to determine pin/behind/front/!front, useful for configuring your !frontarc and behindarc settings. Adjust - this is how much adjustment is required in order to be facing your current target. This value relates to the new allowmove setting. Dist - the distance to your target provided by GetDistance \\(what stick and some moveto, campreturns use\\) , useful in configuring your ArrivalDist values Dist3D - the distance to your target provided by GetDistance3D \\(what snaproll, stucklogic and some moveto parameters use\\) , useful in configuring your ArrivalDist values MQ2Melee \u00b6 What changes did you make that are not found in the normal melee wiki \u00b6 stickrange=75 sticknorange=1 stickdelay=whatever stickmode=1 stickcmd=8 !front strikemode=1 strikecmd=snaproll this way you can use normal paramaters for stickmode/stickcmd and then setup a custom strikecmd and use strikemode=1. strikemode=1 only relates to using a custom strike stick parameter and does not integrate with whatever other methods turn strike on and off. sticknorange=0 (default behavior you are used to) sticknorange=1 (no range checking takes place for stick to happen automatically via mq2melee) update on sticknorange: MQ2Melee does not allow for attacking anything greater than 250 range away regardless of any settings, and sticknorange does not overcome that (though maybe it should be possible?). So sticknorange is effectively \"stick at 250 or less\", without checking the stickrange value (which defaults to 75 if you do not set it). stickbreak=1 - allows breakonkb to work with new mq2melee changes","title":"MQ2MoveUtils:v11 FAQ"},{"location":"plugins/community-plugins/mq2moveutils/mq2moveutils-v11-faq/#mq2moveutilsv11-faq","text":"__NOTOC__","title":"MQ2MoveUtils:v11 FAQ"},{"location":"plugins/community-plugins/mq2moveutils/mq2moveutils-v11-faq/#common-issues","text":"","title":"Common Issues"},{"location":"plugins/community-plugins/mq2moveutils/mq2moveutils-v11-faq/#every-few-seconds-your-character-jerks-his-heading-to-one-side-and-then-resets-jitters","text":"This is caused by stucklogic settings being set incorrectly to the speed of your CPU.

Loose heading rotates your heading changes using a fixed size turn increment to look more legitimate. You are able to set this increment size between 1 and 100.

This will reset to false the next time you issue a /moveto command and upon gamestate changes. Fixed the PAUSED status for the following TLO's with no member: ${MoveTo} ${Stick} ${Circle} ${MakeCamp} ${MoveTo.Broken} once again functions as intended. Stable - 9.0907 \u00b6 Bug fixes for 0817 Beta - 9.0817 - non-linear \u00b6 Major Changes The old style of movement has been reintroduced for WinEQ users i.e. those of you with problems of mouselook or strafe keys being left on when you alt-tab to switch sessions. You may switch over by using: /stick set wineq on This saves to the ini under Defaults as WinEQ=on/off The true movement ability no longer makes the plugin offset-dependent. In the event the offset pattern changes and true movement is not established, the plugin should revert to the old style of movement so there would be no downtime or need to downgrade while waiting for an update. Heading settings are no longer command/INI situational. It applies to the plugin across the board. You may still apply inline adjustments for single command use only. To change plugin default headings, use: /stick set heading true /stick set heading loose /stick set heading fast saves to the ini under Defaults Heading and character-specific section All commands now reset to INI \\(user, not plugin\\) defaults after each use. The INI no longer reloads every time you zone. It will only unload and reload defaults if you use the 'load' parameter \\(ie /stick load\\) or if you camp to character select and re-enter world. Loading the INI file will end commands in progress. Command parameters applied inline will no longer overwrite INI defaults. To change INI defaults, use 'set' or 'toggle' to make changes permanent. The ability to use most INI settings inline has been added. This allows you to issue a command with the setting inline to apply it to the current command, and once the command has ended the next command will revert back to the INI defaults. As an example, if your snaproll default distance was 10.0 and you wanted to make your snaproll distance larger for a single mob, you could: /stick snaproll rear snapdist 20.0 ...and this would snaproll 20 distance behind the target. The next snaproll you issued would then revert to using 10.0 Complete list of supported inline additions: /stick breakontarget breakongate breakonwarp pauseonwarp randomize delaystrafe useback usefleeing strafewalk mindelay \\(when used with stick, this applies to delaystrafe\\) maxdelay # \\(when used with stick, this applies to delaystrafe\\) \u00b6 backupdist # breakdist # snapdist # !frontarc # behindarc # /moveto breakonaggro breakonhit usewalk useback backupdist # ydist # xdist # /makecamp returnhavetarget returnnoaggro returnnotlooting realtimeplayer scatter bearing # scatsize # scatdist # /circle -already had all options Changed INI & Settings Information I cleaned up the INI naming scheme a bit along with some additions and removals so take note of the following \\[Defaults\\] BreakSummonDist --> DistSummon new WinEQ removed TrueHeading new Heading \\(true, loose, fast\\) \\[Stick\\] new AlwaysUW BehindArc --> ArcBehind NotFrontArc -> ArcNotFront BreakDist --> DistBreak BackupDist --> DistBackup new BreakOnTarget removed LooseStick SnaprollDist --> DistSnaproll StickDistMod --> DistMod StickDistModPercent --> DistMod% new UseWalk new UseFleeing \\[MakeCamp\\] new RealtimePlayer \\[MoveTo\\] new AlwaysUW new DistBackup removed LooseMoveTo new UseBackward \\[Circle\\] AlwaysBackwards --> Backward AlwaysCounterClockwise --> CCW AlwaysDrunken --> Drunken \\[Character specific\\] same changes as above where applicable added Heading, same as defaults added RealtimePlayer New Features Added a new command \"/rootme\". This command will effectively lock your character in place until you turn it off with \"/rootme off\", preventing you via the keyboard or the plugin or /keypress from moving you forward. I figured this was within the scope of the plugin and may have some uses such as macro-based GM detection, or eqbc command passing for a character that is about to do something problematic. With rootme active, other commands will not work until you turn it off - though a makecamp on may still fight with it so consider this experimental for now. Added BreakOnTarget option to '/stick', which will break from the current stick if your target changes. /stick set breakontarget on, saves to the INI under Stick BreakOnTarget=on/off Added AlwaysUW options to both stick and moveto \\(individually\\) . the current AutoUW option turns on underwater adjustments automatically only when you are underwater \\(as intended\\) . The new 'alwaysuw' setting will instead always perform the stick or moveto as if you had typed 'uw' inline somewhere. /stick set alwaysuw on, /moveto set alwaysuw on, saves to the INI under Stick AlwaysUW=on/off && MoveTo AlwaysUW=on/off Added 'strafewalk' option to stick. This turns on walking when you are close to the target and using a strafe-based stick parameter. For characters with ridiculously high run speed this will help you position more accurately and should assist background sessions with moving slower and not overshooting the destination. /stick set strafewalk on, ini Stick UseWalk=on/off Added 'usefleeing' option to stick for 'stick front'. If the target is fleeing \\(same check as the TLO\\) and under 25% health, stick front will not attempt to strafe and reposition in front of the target. This is still experimental. Added 'useback' to moveto. Just like with stick, if you are close to the moveto destination (which also includes camp returns), this will walk backwards to the destination rather than turning, facing the destination, walking there, and turning again. /moveto set useback on, ini: MoveTo UseBack=on/off Set the distance same way as stick \\(though unlike stick, you probably want a larger value here\\) /moveto set backupdist # \\(1.0 min\\) . moveto and stick save their own distances, not use the same. Added 'realtimeplayer' setting to camp returning. Previous '/makecamp player' behavior set the location of the player, and began moving there. if the player moved during that time, it would walk to the old location first and then begin moving again. realtimeplayer now makes the positions dynamic and will adjust a return on the fly. i made this optional in case anyone used that as some form of ghetto advpath. /makecamp set realtimeplayer on BreakOnGM now displays a timestamp for zone in & zone out times. if you see one blink in and out within a matter of seconds, they went invis and you should not consider yourself safe. Bug Fixes & Cleanup HideHelp now functions as the output message describes instead of in reverse. '/stick front' will no longer take the 'long way' around the mob to get back into position. Rewrote the UI window class to fix several bugs. Stripped the command history & output box from the UI window. The UI window should remain up when you are hovering When triggered, BreakOnGM & BreakOnSummon will prevent future commands from being used and output a message, rather than allow the commands to be accepted but then the plugin does nothing. ReturnHaveTarget, ReturnNoAggro, and ReturnNotLooting will now all perform their checks so that if you have multiple options enabled, one will not prevent the other from taking place. Changed the randomize formula a bit, though it may not have helped any. Setting the behindarc setting will actually take effect. Stucklogic should be less aggressive if a character is walking AutoPause will no longer apply if only makecamp is active and not returning Fixed the stick healer / uw parameter bug '/calcangle' has more data added to the output stick commands should no longer cause the character to run in circles around the target (noticeably taking a while to correct itself) if you turned it on when close to the target and facing certain angles. delaystrafe should now work exactly as intended / problem free, and i suggest using it always, especially for those who do not regularly have HOTT data mousepause & mpause will no longer try to resume when the plugin was paused by the user \\(ie /stick pause\\) if you ditch your stick target while mpause / mousepause is in effect, the plugin will take note instantly instead of waiting the normal delay time and then attempting to resume followed by breaking later pause/breakonkb \\(with true movement\\) should not interfere with your keypresses unless your ubermicro beats the speed of the threading. for mpause if you are using the oldstyle movement it will still behave as it did before (if you hold down two keys and let one go, the timer starts from the first key even though you still have the second key held). a bug with zoning while a pause was active causing keybinds movement to be broken while the plugin was loaded has been fixed \\(rare case\\) Development - 9.0608 - verbosity rewrite, stick healer, breakongm \u00b6 Rewrote the verbosity system to be based off bit flags. This allows the user full control of every message that will or will not be displayed by the plugin. Read this wiki entry for the flags table and details on how it works, and what specific messages are tied to what bit flags. I have converted the old system, so if the new system is a bit confusing, verbosity , fullverbosity , autopauseoutput , and totalsilence still work very close to as before. I have not updated the wiki yet with the new commands, Usage: /stick verbflags - Lists your current verbosity bit flags (useful for knowing what to add/subtract from if you want to make a single change) /stick set verbflags # - Sets your verbosity flags to # (where # is the total sum of whatever flags you added up, check the wiki link) note: if you set # to 0 or a negative number, it is equivalent to totalsilence Numerical flags value saves to the INI under [Defaults] as \"VerbosityFlags\" and to [server.char] section as well. The totalsilence option now applies to everything, and not 'almost everything'. Added a new verbosity toggle so that you do not have to memorize 33554431, and may use */stick toggle totalverbosity* to turn on every message possible. Added a new safety option, BreakOnGM. This works similar to BreakOnSummon. When active, it will scan OnAddSpawn for a GM type zoning in. If a visible GM/Guide does zone in, the plugin will halt any active MoveUtils commands and prevent future MoveUtils command usage until you unlock it \\(same command as BreakOnSummon - _/stick imsafe_\\) . I highly recommend you turn on the verbosity bit flags for this if you are using this feature, as otherwise you may wonder why your commands are not working. Usage: /stick toggle breakongm Saves to the INI under [Defaults] as \"BreakOnGM\" Added a new TLO member ${MoveUtils.GM}, which returns TRUE if the GM detection has fired and the plugin is currently locked. Added a new stick type, /stick healer . **This does not work with any custom angles (pin, front, !front, behind, behindonce, snaproll).** This is useful for those who may wish to stick their healer to another group member to keep them following without having them look like they are sticking. **The main difference of this stick type is that until the character is out of stick range, it will not perform any heading adjustments**. For example, currently if you stick your healer to your tank, every time the tank moves the healer would turn to be facing directly at the tank and it is very noticeable. With /stick healer , you can issue a command such as /stick 100 hold healer and as long as your healer is within 100 range of the tank, it will sit still and not turn at all. Once the tank moves beyond 100 range, the healer would then turn to face it and move until it is within 100 range again. If you keep autopause off, targeting yourself while sticking will now halt your movement until you target something else \\(unless you are using stick id/hold\\) . AutoPause on includes this functionality, but if you have it off and switched from an NPC to yourself with moveback enabled, previously you would try to move away from yourself, backing up forever. This displays a message as well, and is tied to the Autopause verbosity flag. Unducking will now also use /stand instead of hitting the duck key, which in very rare cases would also cause a server desync. WTB /stand as a native EQ mappable key. The fullverbosity message for stick will no longer display the mod output unless you actually have a mod active. The fullverbosity message for stick now will reflect HEALER if /stick healer is used. Issuing /makecamp on/player will no longer automatically stand the user up. Fixed a bug with BreakOnWarp / PauseOnWarp when using very large stick distances. Stable - 9.0526 - UI window \u00b6 Added an optional dedicated UI window for the plugin. Usage \\(may use any of the 4 commands\\) : /stick toggle window - toggles window display /stick set font # - sets window font size (1 to 10) /stick min - minimizes the window (like /mqmin) /stick clear - clears the window (like /mqclear) Development - 9.0524 \u00b6 Added two more fixes to help prevent possible turn keys being left on Moveback will wait until snaproll and other drastic heading changes have completed before kicking in. (thanks above posters) Confirmed the 'moveto spinning' reported by Magoo was due to GetDistance3D not reaching its ArrivalDist. All moveto \\(including 'id'\\) and camp returns once again use GetDistance except the special case of /moveto y x z. If you supply a z parameter that your character cannot reach, you will rotate in place above or below the unreachable z point endlessly. Bottom line: use sanity checking on your z locations if you opt to use this. Don't guesstimate. BehindArc can now be set by the user. /stick set behindarc #, saves to the INI under Stick \"BehindArc\" and the CharName sections. Snaproll distance can now be set by the user. This is the distance behind (or in front/side if you are using custom position) the target where the snap location is plotted. For reference, the default has been 10.0. If you frequently snaproll behind targets near walls and other tight objects with a large snapdist set you may run into problems. Usage: /stick set snapdist #, saves to the INI under Stick \"SnaprollDist\" and the CharName sections. New feature 'pauseonwarp'. Instead of breaking from stick like BreakOnWarp currently does, pauseonwarp will stop movement and pause until the target is once again within BreakDist range. Pause or Break, not both at the same time. saves to INI under Stick \"PauseOnWarp\" and command /stick toggle pauseonwarp. Tightened up breakonsummon formula to work more efficiently BreakSummonDist can now be set in game, not just via INI: /stick set summondist # AutoUW defaults to false instead of true. TurnRate minimum lowered from 12.0 to 1.0. if you want to turn slow, more power to you. Useback has been cleaned up and should work more effectively. delaystrafe should work fully as intended and not fail to strafe in some cases - please report any more problems with this as it may need more testing \\(thanks LrdDread\\) /stick id #, with self targeted, will work as intended \\(thanks dkaa\\) /stick hold, followed by /stick without hold will no longer reset incorrectly. if you were previously using /stick hold and then issuing a second /stick to make changes to active stick parameters while keeping the hold going this will no longer work. AutoPause with loose/true heading will no longer attempt to keep adjusting heading, and will halt turning when active \\(thanks LrdDread\\) Changed ${Stick.MovePause} TLO member to ${MoveUtils.MovePause} as it applies to more than stick. ${Stick.Behind} will now also be accurate from the target's right arc, not just the left. Camp returns use their own floats now, so that TLO members such as ${MoveTo.Stopped} and ${MoveTo.CampStopped} are reflected separately. Changed the fullverbosity output for stick from Head \\(fast/true/loose\\) Water \\(yes/no\\) Hold \\(yes/no\\) to only display what is active i.e.: Head \\(true\\) ID \\(31337\\) Head \\(true\\) ID \\(31337\\) UW Head \\(true\\) UW MB \\(the MB is new, and reflects if MoveBack is enabled\\) /moveto loc y x z - will display the z loc in verbosity if used commands that shouldn't have a reason to stand up will not try to Development - 9.0419 - bug fixes, uw enhancement \u00b6 Ending commands & pausing the plugin should no longer cause the turn keys to be left on. Please let me know if there are still cases where the \"spinning\" happens as I may not have got them all. Fixed an issue with stucklogic attempting to get unstuck when it was not. Stucklogic when underwater should no longer almost always think it is stuck. The current formula may not be tight enough so you may run into cases where stucklogic will not get unstuck while underwater. This will need more tweaking in the future. For now, this prevents the endless spinning when underwater. Stucklogic will no longer try to jump when underwater if TryToJump is enabled. Added a new option AutoUW which will automatically turn on underwater face angle adjustments when fully underwater. This will affect moveto and stick commands when active and the plugin detects you are underwater and you have a target. This is enabled by default. If you frequently use /moveto or /makecamp while underwater and having a target unrelated to your destination, you may want to disable this option. Usage: /stick toggle autouw Saves to the INI as AutoUW under Defaults and server.char sections. The /moveto loc command now accepts an optional Z axis. If you use /moveto loc Y X as before, it will behave as it always did. If you use /moveto loc Y X Z , it will now use the Z axis in a GetDistance3D comparison. \\(See Below\\) Moveto now uses GetDistance3D instead of GetDistance to process being in range of ArrivalDist in some cases. If you currently use a small arrivaldist you may need to increase the size if when arriving at the moveto destination your character keeps attempting to reposition themselves. This only applies to /moveto id or if the Z axis is supplied in the /moveto loc Y X z format. This will not affect precisey, precisex, or camp returns. Moveto now accepts the uw and underwater parameters, which will adjust your face angle based on the height and location of your current target. Note you cannot /moveto id uw , but you can /moveto uw id or */moveto id 12345 uw* Loose/True heading anti-orbit angle value is now able to be configured by the user. It still defaults to 32.0f, so if everything works fine for you there is no need to change it. You may adjust the value with: /stick set allowmove # \\(e.g. /stick set allowmove 64.0 \\) Saves to the INI as AllowMove under Defaults and server.char sections. TurnRate cap has been increased from 24.0 to 100.0, though I wouldn't suggest going that high. the pause parameter, and kb/mouse break/pause will now halt heading adjustments for loose/true heading (previously seen example: typing /stick pause and seeing your heading still finish the rotation afterward) gFaceAngle will now be reset by the plugin if moveto, circle, or stick is active (meaning you cannot use /face during those cases). Hitting turn left/right with breakonkb/mpause will once again allow you to continue turning UseBack defaults to false instead of true Added output for GetDistance and GetDistance3D to the /calcangle command. (Able to see the differences in distance to help set arrivaldist values based on your usage) Development - 9.0412 - Major Release \u00b6 All movement is now tied directly to the variables used by eqgame. This plugin now uses self-finding offsets, though they are no different than the current __RunWalkState type of offset provided in the main compile. This has allowed me to end the over-compensation needed to stop movement and prevent the shooting off into the distance that plagued the original version. In testing, movement is less choppy and more accurate than ever before. As an extra precaution, I also have made the applicable keyboard flags reflect being pressed \\(like MQ2's keybinds do\\) while any movement is active. YOU MAY NEED TO READJUST YOUR STUCKLOGIC SETTINGS Along with this comes a new feature, \"true heading\". This uses the actual turn left and turn right movement keys to perform heading adjustments. This is enabled by default as loose heading was before. If you do not wish to use this, you may /stick toggle alwaystruehead to turn it off for good. By using actual turning, the turnspeed multiplier and heading change increments are now 100% legit. Loose heading logic is still provided for those who want to go quasi-legit with a custom turn increment, and fast heading is the same as before. Note if you disabled loose heading because you want fast heading, you will now also need to disable true heading. When enabled (again, it is on by default) it will apply to stick and moveto both, not separately like loose heading works. Ways to use this: /stick ____ truehead _- usable inline with any other parameters /stick toggle truehead - toggle truehead for current command in process /stick toggle alwaystruehead - toggle using it always Saves to INI as TrueHeading under Defaults . This also saves to the character-specific setting if _savebychar is turned on. Added an optional strafe delay timer to prevent instant strafing when mobs turn for a short period of time such as quick spells, or gaining aggro without HoTT. Consider this, properly configured, a replacement to the old nohott and a fix to an issue reported by LrdDread. Ways to use this: /stick toggle delaystrafe - turns the delay for strafe-based movement \\(pin, !front, front, behind\\) on or off /stick set strafemindelay # - sets the minimum amount of time you wish to delay before strafing \\(in miliseconds\\) . The default is 1500 \\(1.5 seconds\\) . /stick set strafemaxdelay # - sets the maximum amount of time you wish to wait before strafing \\(in miliseconds\\) . The default is 3000 \\(3 seconds\\) . Saves to the INI under Stick as DelayStrafe, and StrafeMinDelay / StrafeMaxDelay. The size of the arc for /stick !front is now configurable by the user. You may use: /stick set !frontarc # - Valid ranges 260.0 to 1.0. The default is 135.0 and if you do not adjust it, it will continue to behave like normal. Saves to the INI as NotFrontArc under Stick . This also saves to the character-specific setting if savebychar is turned on. Implemented optional arc randomization for pin/!front/behind. You may enable this with /stick toggle randomize . My formula is pretty basic so it will not be anything special yet, but its a foundation for improvement in the next release down the road. This saves to the INI as RandomArc under Stick , and if you have fullverbosity enabled then behind/!front will also output their arc values to the chatwnd. Added a command, /calcangle , which dumps the value moveutils uses to determine angular dist (useful if you want to configure your !front arc) or know what the randomization values represent. When rewriting loose heading I had inadvertently disabled a feature of the original MoveUtils. With loose heading enabled: when very close to your target it would walk backwards to stick instead of turning to face the target, moving into stick position, and turning to face the target again. This is now enabled by default . I noticed in some cases it can end up causing your character to move in crazy-eight style patterns, and adjusted the math to correct this. Using moveback in your stick commands overcomes that problem with ease, but if you do not like to use moveback and/or run into that problem often, please report a solid way of recreating it here and then consider turning it off based on your play style. Unlike the old moveutils, I have made this feature optional. Ways to use this: /stick toggle useback - turns the backwards walking on and off /stick set backupdist # - how close to the target you can be to use backward walking. The smaller the better . This defaults to 10.0 like the old moveutils Saves to INI as UseBackward and BackupDist under Stick Snaproll now uses GetDistance3D to prevent certain bugs related to being unable to get in range of a target on large slopes. I have left the old line in place so if you have any issues with snaprolls, you may uncomment the old line and comment out the new one \\(fGetSnapDist around line 4100\\) Snaproll now sets the final heading adjustment before handling control back over to normal stick. AutoPause now has an optional message output, so you can have greater awareness of why your character is suddenly standing still doing nothing. You may enable/disable this with /stick toggle autopauseoutput . If this is enabled, it will not respect totalsilence so you will need to configure this on its own. This saves to the INI as AutoPauseMsg under Defaults . MoveTo now has two new BreakOn options \\(my implementation of a suggestion from dkaa\\) . They are different forms of detecting aggro during a /moveto that will halt the command. This mostly assists macro writers in being able to stop moving to a location and handle the event of getting aggro during the move. Ways to use this: /moveto toggle breakonaggro - this will halt the moveto if you gain aggro \\(crossed-swords indicator\\) /moveto toggle breakonhit - this will halt the moveto if you are swung at \\(both contact or miss\\) , if you want to keep moving until something is actually trying to hit you. I have added support for all three types of hitmodes, though if you use the \"number only\", I am only parsing for misses not the numerics and you are annoying to support . If you wish to use this, you should consider switching to abbreviated or normal. Saves to the INI under BreakOnAggro and BreakOnHit under MoveTo . In the event either of these trigger: A new TLO member, ${MoveTo.Broken} will show as true, so that you may see if the event fired. This will not reset to false until the next time you issue a /moveto command. - An output message will display to the chatwnd \\(if you do not have _totalsilence_ enabled\\) Fixed a problem with the /stick pin formula on one side of the target not positioning correctly. Camp returns and moveto's now resume after pausing the plugin and unpausing with /stick pause|unpause . Mousepause will no longer spam if the pause flips active with only a makecamp setup and attempting to auto-return. Makecamp will no longer try to return while mouselook movement is active. Once the return begins and you attempt to use the mouse though it still will not let you, so if you use mouselook movement often consider turning on mousepause or breakonmouse. BreakOnGate has been switched from OnIncomingChat to a Blech event. Please report if this does not work as intended. Bard detection has switched from string parsing to numeric comparison. It will now only check once every time you type a command \\(to support switching to shrouds with the plugin loaded\\) instead of OnPulse. If you switch to a shroud with stick active, please stab yourself and then you will need to end the command and restart it to detect the class change. ReturnNoTarget has been renamed to ReturnHaveTarget , as the naming incorrectly implied the opposite of what it actually does. The command is also updated: /makecamp toggle returnhavetarget . Loose \\(yes/no\\) output in fullverbosity has been changed to Head \\(true/loose/fast\\) MakeCamp Leash and Delay value output has been slightly modified. Fixed some cases where BreakOnWarp and BreakOnSummon would incorrectly fire \\(mainly due to mpause/mousepause\\) and cleaned up the logic. Removed nohott \\(AwareAggro in the INI\\) as it has been nothing but problematic. Removed the MQ2Melee /mutils output Renamed the keybinds, so you may want to cleanup your MacroQuest.ini after loading this. Nerfed the ability to /stick id # to your mount. Nerfed the ability to /makecamp player to your mount. Major plugin logic overhaul, code cleanup, \"best practices\" and general bug fixes. Stable - 9.0314 \u00b6 Fix for strafe not properly turning off in some cases, most commonly if you got on HoTT \\(thanks rswiders\\) nohott option will no longer process when it is enabled and you actually do have the HoTT LAA active and showing you on HoTT \\(thanks fearless\\) nohott should be less aggressive and less prone to spinning endlessly (relates to both fixes above and LrdDread's post a while back) Bug Fix for BreakOnSummon \\(= != ==\\) Bug Fix for Debug options All MQ2Melee exports are now in the release, there will no longer be 2 separate versions of MoveUtils 9.x to worry about if you are using my changes to MQ2Melee. Misc. code cleanup and dewindefification Stable - 9.0225 - minor \u00b6 Fix for verbosity level output bug that has been present since the change to the way this works in November. Stable - 9.0110 - minor \u00b6 /makecamp Y X and /circle y x are no longer valid inputs. this may break some macros. Added new syntax: /makecamp loc Y X and /circle loc Y X as replacements. Please report if any problems or odd behavior due to this change. TurnHalf is now functional again for stucklogic. Saves to ini or toggled via command line: /stick toggle turnhalf Snaproll left/right math corrected by deadchicken Added ${MoveUtils.Version} TLO member by request Stable - 9.0101 - fixes/TLO \u00b6 Most problems reported should be fixed. Get this version and delete your ini file. Anyone that was using loose heading and had issues they should be corrected now as well, as long as you delete your INI file. Corrected a bug with camp return and moveto. Corrected a bug with makecamp return and altreturn if too close to camp. Camp return scattering should once again function as deadchicken intended. CampRadius now stores to the character section of the INI file. Adjusted the default values for stucklogic a bit \\(not the only reason to delete the ini\\) Returned keypress down, up and down, up, down as not having it causes characters to run off into the abyss in some cases. Added New TLO's: ${MakeCamp.ReturnNoAggro} - bool ${MakeCamp.ReturnNotLooting} - bool ${MakeCamp.ReturnNoTarget} - bool ${MakeCamp.Scatter} - bool ${MakeCamp.Bearing} - float ${MakeCamp.ScatDist} - float ${MakeCamp.ScatSize} - float ${MoveTo.ArrivalDist} - float ${MoveTo.ArrivalDistY} - float ${MoveTo.ArrivalDistX} - float ${MoveTo.UseWalk} - bool ${MoveUtils.PulseCheck} - int ${MoveUtils.PulseUnstuck} - int ${MoveUtils.DistStuck} - float ${MoveUtils.TryToJump} - bool === Beta - 8.1227 - bug fixes === note: this was a bad release, if you are still using it, delete it. Cleaned up loose heading function to not set heading to illegal values Removed the excessive double/float conversions. Circle radius and gLookAngle should be the only double math used anymore. Fix for leash bug reported by Kroak Beta - 8.1224 - tweaks \u00b6 snaproll now has a distance check so if it is close enough to the destination it will not try to roll again a very small amount in place. snaproll moves 10 units away, and this new distance check is 5 units. snaproll will now accept destination as a parameter. Usage: /stick snaproll rear \\(normal behavior and not necessary, you can use _/stick snaproll_ as before\\) /stick snaproll face - front of target /stick snaproll left - snaproll to the target's right shoulder /stick snaproll right - snaproll to the target's left shoulder If enabled... stucklogic will no longer try to jump when levitating stucklogic will no longer try to jump if not moving stucklogic will now work if using strafing stucklogic will now be used whenever stick is active, instead of not if you are within stickdist (except the normal skip conditions: summoned, stunned, snared, rooted) Autopause will now apply to rooted No commands will try to move if rooted Fixed pin/!front/rear errors when snared Changed DoMovement to not press up and down again Beta - 8.1221 - deadchicken stucklogic rewrite \u00b6 Stucklogic has gotten a major overhaul - **It is highly recommended that you delete your old INI and re-set / copy over any values you wish to keep not related to stucklogic**. Stucklogic uses new values for a new formula written by deadchicken. This formula calculates your pulse averages based on a table, with greater accuracy than before. The new values are configured as such: /stick set pulsecheck # pulsecheck defaults to 4 this value is sort of what \"stuckcheck\" was before. it serves as the size of your pulse history to be used to calculate your average movement distance. the largest you can set this value to is 32 \\(defined by MAXRINGSIZE\\) . The higher you set this number, the less often stucklogic would misfire \\(so if you are getting the \"jittery\" problem you will want to increase this value\\) . This also means it will take longer to know that it is stuck, so if you are getting stuck and not responding fast enough, you would do the opposite and lower this value. /stick set pulseunstuck # - pulseunstuck defaults to 5 - this value is new - this is the amount of pulses you have successfully moved forward before hard-forcing stucklogic to be considered unstuck. this serves the purpose in that if you were stuck for 20 pulses, your stuck counter would normally try to move forward for 20 more pulses before considering itself free. there was some handling for this that had some issues so now you can set a value such as this one to force a faster \"im unstuck\" process. - the higher your framerate, the higher you want this value. 5 may not be enough on better computers and you may end up getting restuck again, it will look like what we are calling \"snaking\". If you notice yourself \"snaking\" then this would be the first value to try increasing. /stick set diststuck #.## - diststuck defaults to 0.5 - this is similar to before in that it is the amount of distance you need to have moved versus your average pulse rate in order to not be stuck - this value should properly scale for all speeds of computers. you may want to set it higher or lower, play with it and find what works best (and please let us know!!), but keep in mind setting this value to something tiny such as 0.001 as we did in the old logic should no longer be necessary. deadchicken has determined that mindset was only working because of some incorrect math in the formulas. try to stick with more logical values and then reporting back your results would be appreciated. '''The following needs more testing/information: stucklogic behavior when snared stucklogic behavior underwater stucklogic behavior when mounted \\(all different speeds of mounts\\) ''' Please note the old values and logic behind setting them no longer applies. I've changed their names in the INI so that no one can mistakenly use crappy settings because they did not read any of this. Added jumping support, which will try to jump to overcome obstacles. For as simple as this sounds, this will prevent you from getting stuck on small obstacles the majority of the time. It works awesome, to the point we had to disable it to test a lot of the other aspects of the new formulas. This defaults to true, so if undesired you may disable this with /stick toggle trytojump \\(or set on/off\\) Stucklogic now uses GetDistance3D instead of GetDistance to compare movement between pulses, so changes in z axis should be factored into movement. This should correct the bug with stucklogic firing when walking up and down inclines, but please report if it is working as intended or not. It was working correctly in our testing. Rewrote a lot of the main function to reduce the number of evaluations processed per pulse by 30% (made up figure, it was a large portion) Bards can once again use AutoPause \\(all aspects except casting spells\\) /stick snaproll should now be 100% accurate and no longer overshoot the target due to getting stuck along the way. Thanks deadchicken for his camp scatter math which worked perfectly for this formula too. Please report any cases where it is having problems, but I hope there should be none now. Switching targets mid-stick will no longer trigger stucklogic or breakonwarp. If you target a mob that is out of server-update radius, breakonwarp can still fire once you receive accurate location data for the target. Cross-map targeting stuff is bad, let alone with stick still on . breakdist may now be set in game with /stick set breakdist #.## Added a new feature to MakeCamp courtesy of deadchicken: scattering. This is a bit complex but when configured properly it is amazing. The idea behind this is that instead of returning to a random location within your camp radius, you can define a specific bearing, distance, and scatter radius from the center of your camp. This way you could configure your characters to return to specified areas all the time. The INI supports values on a character by character basis as well, so you could configure your tank to return to the center, your casters to return behind the tank, and your melee to return to the sides of the tank. To configure the values the commands are: /makecamp toggle usescatter Turn on/off scattering /makecamp set bearing #.## - set scatter bearing /makecamp set scatsize #.## - set scatter radius /makecamp set scatdist #.## - set scatter distance Leash length can now be set to >= camp radius, instead of just > AltCamp now retains its own radius size. Added new MakeCamp TLO's relating to the distance from your camp. ${MakeCamp.CampDist} - float - distance from your current camp \\(0.00 if makecamp is off\\) ${MakeCamp.AltCampDist} - float - distance from your altcamp \\(0.00 if altcamp has not been established\\) ${MakeCamp.AltRadius} - float - radius size of your altcamp MoveTo now allows for ArrivalDist to be set as low as 1.0. MoveTo now has the option to turn on walk when closing in on the arrival destination to maximize precision. This defaults to true so if you do not want to use this, then /moveto toggle usewalk . Autosave \\(save to INI when issuing a _set_ or _toggle_ parameter\\) now defaults to true. Added savebychar as optional for the INI. Defaults to true as that was the old behavior. Use */stick toggle savebychar* to disable saving/loading character-specific settings. Added optional INI value YourCharName \"DisregardMe=true\". This allows you to use character-specific settings but ignore them on a specific character and use defaults instead. Manually add this line for the characters you wish to use defaults on, and leave it off \\(or you could put =false, but no need\\) for those you wish to continue using specifics. Fixed a crash bug related to using /stick id 2mooks . The \"id\" parameter now enforces all numerics. strtoul ftw. Fixed a bug with stick 'always' not processing mpause/mousepause/breakonkb/breakonmouse if you had a target when you issued the command, until you had no target and got a new target again. Fixed a small bug with min/max delays requiring 126 instead of 125 difference. Fixed a bug where if you unloaded the plugin mid-command walk would be left on. Fixed a bug with breakonsummon firing the first time you issued a command. Disabled advancedautopause as I'm out of ideas. checkbard has been removed \\(forever\\) . Stripped /followpath from this plugin. Use MQ2AdvPath instead. Other new set / toggles: /circle set circleradius #.## - set radius on the fly /makecamp set leashlength #.## - set leashlength on the fly /makecamp set campradius #.## - set camp radius on the fly /makecamp toggle leash - toggle leash on and off Cleaned up the debug command output. Cleaned up the help command output. Added new help command format to display detailed information on the plugins settings as it has grown large. \\(_/stick help settings_\\) All options that could previously be toggled or previously be set on/off now may be used both ways. So for example autopause, you have the option of doing: /stick toggle autopause /stick set autopause off /stick set autopause on Use the \"help settings\" parameter for more information. === Beta - 8.1205 - deadchicken polar math === Corrected the bugs with BreakOnSummon that would cause occasional misfires in /stick , and consistent misfires with /circle . This feature now works as intended \\(and its very useful in gm-detection detection\\) . deadchicken has generously offered up his polar-math code for camp returns, which is much smoother, more seamless, and far more accurate in generating a return to camp. This also makes /makecamp player work much better. Many thanks to deadchicken for this simple yet elegant contribution to the plugin. Beta - 8.1202 - makecamp cleanup \u00b6 makecamp return delay and mpause/mousepause resume delay are now on separate values. They are now able to be configured independently via commandline or within the INI. Important: The old ini values no longer apply, so if you use non-default settings you need to adjust them again based on the following \\(you can use any command, its not restricted to _/makecamp_\\) To set the delays for camp return /makecamp set campmindelay #.## /makecamp set campmaxdelay #.## - - To set the delays for mpause/mousepause return: /makecamp set pausemindelay #.## /makecamp set pausemaxdelay #.## You will now need to use different INI values for these delays. Defaults \"MinDelay\" and \"MaxDelay\" no longer do anything. For mpause/mousepause: [Defaults] PauseMinDelay=125 PauseMaxDelay=250 For makecamp return times: [MakeCamp] MinDelay=250 MaxDelay=500 The ${MakeCamp.MinDelay} and ${MakeCamp.MaxDelay} members now refer to the campmindelay and campmaxdelay settings only There are new TLO members for the pausemindelay and pausemaxdelay settings: ${MoveUtils.PauseMinDelay} and ${MoveUtils.PauseMaxDelay} This change has allowed for the return of inline min/max delay for makecamp, you can use it as it was before. Examples: /makecamp mindelay 150 maxdelay 500 /makecamp on maxdelay 500 /makecamp on mindelay 150 maxdelay 500 There is now the ability to retain an \"altcamp\" location stored. Right now this is only used for one purpose, being able to return to the altcamp location. This is very barebones at the moment, and works as follows You go to a location and turn on a camp \\(ie /makecamp on\\) You turn off your camp \\(ie /makecamp off\\) The location that was your camp is now the altcamp location. You now have two options to utilize the old camp: At any time, as long as you remain in the same zone, you can /makecamp altreturn . This will return you to the altcamp location, aka the location of your camp that is now off. This works how makecamp return with no camp active tried to work, but without the bugs that existed with it. You move to another location and setup a new camp \\(ie _/makecamp on_\\) . With this new camp active, you can /makecamp altreturn . This will turn OFF your current camp \\(so as not to get stuck trying to stay there\\) and move to the altcamp location. * Note: You cannot altreturn until you've setup a camp at least once in the current zone. * Note: The Altcamp values reset if you die or zone. * Note: You cannot altreturn if currently using a player-camp. There are two new TLO members that keep track of the altcamp location. If they are both == 0.0 then you do not have an altcamp setup. They are ${MakeCamp.AltAnchorX} and ${MakeCamp.AltAnchorY} The \"on\" parameter for /stick may now be used anywhere inline again, since removing that broke popular macros like RH. Please note the on parameter is useless in this version of MoveUtils. In the original version it was able to overcome a bug with breakonwarp \\(which is fixed\\) , so now it does nothing that any other /stick parameter does not do. This is only for retro-support, using it in your macros is bad practice. If you use precisey or precisex as a parameter in your /moveto command, it will now display your YDist or XDist values in the output \\(sorry for the long delay in this request\\) Added an experimental features for those of you bards that are having the \"jittery\" problem when StuckLogic is enabled. Following the suggested quickfix earlier in the thread, if you enable a new option checkbard , your speedmultiplier is divided by two if you are a bard class. This only applies to bards, not everyone with selos. This feature is disabled by default, so if you wish to test it, use \\(_/stick set checkbard on\\|off_ then _/stick save_\\) . This saves to the ini under Defaults \"CheckBard\" Turning this on as a non-bard will not do anything, so turning it on for your bard alt and loading up another character will not affect your non-bard. If this solution works, I could work on detecting if selo's is present and open this to all classes, but I think it would be better to find out what the problem in the stucklogic formula is, and try to fix that instead. If you wish to help, please read a few posts back about the formula and issues. For those of you who wish to return to camp when you are outside of the camp radius, regardless of if you have a target or aggro, there is a new option ReturnNoTarget. The previous new feature ReturnNoAggro will ignore target as well, but only return if you do not have aggro. ReturnNoTarget works with ReturnNoAggro OFF, and will return when you exceed the camp radius, target or not. Thanks to Muley for the suggestion. Usage \\(**/makecamp enforced**\\) : /makecamp set returnnotarget on|off This saves to the INI [MakeCamp] ReturnNoTarget=on Identified a bug with snaproll where it would not stop moving/readjust heading if stucklogic kicked in or if the player moved with mpause/mousepause in the middle of the roll. I've taken steps to correct the issue. If you are close to the target, the problem should be gone unless your snaproll runs you into a wall. If you are far away from the target, there is a chance your roll will still continue on beyond the normal distance \\(due to stucklogic or mousepause/mpause\\) but it will now halt if it travels the same distance beyond the target that you were when you issued the command. The problem would still exist if you snaprolled from 100 units away, got stuck along the way, you will run 100 units beyond the mob before snaprolling. I'm working on a better formula to address this problem. In the meantime, snaproll still works as it did before, just with more checking and correction of heading/movement. Shortrolls should have little to no problem. This feature will be improved in the future. Cleaned up the help command output to reflect new settings that were missing, or settings that no longer applied. A few of the newer ones may still be missing. Beta - 8.1123 - loose enhancement \u00b6 Rewrote loose heading to be calculated and adjusted within this plugin, using a fixed turn increment Note: the maximum rate you turn when holding the right/left keys down is 16.0, and hence the default This turn increment can be configured by the user for any number within 12.0 and 24.0 Lower than 12.0 will cause awkward stuttering Higher than 24.0 is noticeable hax and you may as well use fast heading To configure in game, you may use /stick set turnrate 12.0 If you use a value out of bounds, it will not change the rate To configure in the ini, you may use Defaults \"TurnRate\" section If you use a value out of bounds, it will use the plugin default of 16.0 and resave this value to your ini Adjusted /stick snaproll to use this new math, and improved the calculations to determine when to roll so it should no longer roll early Beta - 8.1119 - minor \u00b6 Removed ${Stick.Aggro} TLO Added ${MoveUtils.Aggro} TLO this TLO now functions any time you have a target instead of only when /stick is active This check is still calculated the same way, it is not \"true\" aggro detection This checks your target's heading relative to your heading via angular distance math. If you are facing your target and your target is facing you, you are aggro. If your target is facing you and you are facing AWAY from your target, the math will show your aggro as false ideally this is still only worth using if you are facing your target \\(which _/stick_ always did\\) and not in any other case * By request, added /stick snaproll \\(thanks Agripa for the name, which is based off flight terminology\\) * This command is designed to be used like /stick behind * This runs in a straight line to the rear arc of the target based on your targets heading, spins in place, and then turn on /stick behind automatically afterwards This uses and enforces loose heading/stick, so it will not snap your heading instantly I have not incorporated this into NoHoTT checking so either use this (by detecting ${MoveUtils.Aggro} is true have your macro issue the command) or nohott but dont try to use both together as they do opposite things * By request, added an option to /makecamp , ReturnNotLooting, which will not return to camp automatically until you no longer have a loot window up \\(or manually issued a _/makecamp return\\) _ This defaults to false so everything behaves as you are familiar with If you wish to use this, it can be set up as follows MakeCamp \"ReturnNotLooting\" on/off in the ini /makecamp set returnnotlooting on\\|off Beta - 8.1116 - minor \u00b6 Fix for /makecamp no parameters Added status parameter which dumps the status of the command used, or status all which dumps complete status of the plugin /moveto status will only display info related to moveto, circle status only to circle, and makecamp status only to makecamp all for every command will dump status for every command as well as all other plugin settings These will display regardless of if you have totalsilence set to on Example: /stick status will output MQ2MoveUtils Current Status Stick: Status(on) Dir(Behind) Dist(10.0) Mod(0.0) Mod%(0.0) Loose(yes) Water(no) MoveBack(yes) Hold(yes) Always(yes) Stick: Holding to ID(1115) Name(Guide Peyote) <---only displays if holding Stick Options: AlwaysLoose(on) BreakOnWarp(on) BreakDist(300.00) BreakOnGate(on) Beta - 8.1111 - moveto enhance / misc \u00b6 By request, added new parameters to /moveto loc , precisey and precisex When used these will move in the general direction of the loc specified and stop moving when it gets in the acceptable arrival distance for that location, disregarding the other This is to be used as a trailing paramater to /moveto loc Using it with /moveto id or the new /moveto yloc/xloc will likely cause problems so don't do it Usage example: /moveto loc -100 -200 precisey - will head towards -100 -200, but stop when it gets within acceptable Y arrival distance even if your loc is -100 -500 - This is not the same as new command */moveto yloc/xloc* in that it does head in the desired direction first until it reaches the \"precise\" desired - The other command below will beeline with no regard to the other coordinate Added two new settings to support the precisey and precisex trailing parameters These also save to the ini under MoveTo as \"ArrivalDistY\" and \"ArrivalDistX\" Usage: /moveto set xdist 10.00 /moveto set ydist 10.00 (default is 10, can use any .2 digit float) Changed INI setting for MoveTo \"ArrivalDistance\" to \"ArrivalDist\" Added /moveto yloc \\# and /moveto xloc \\# which will use your current x \\(yloc\\) /y \\(xloc\\) and beeline for the x \\(xloc\\) or y \\(yloc\\) you requested Included fix for /moveto dist reset problem reported by KFH By request, added a new option for makecamp returning only if not aggro currently if you have a camp setup makecamp will return to camp if you are outside of the camp radius and do not have a target. this is still the default, so if you like this, you don't have to do anything if you wish to change this so that you will return only if you are not aggro, with or without a target, you can enable this using: /makecamp toggle returnnoaggro - this will also save to the ini under \\[MakeCamp\\] \"ReturnNoAggro\" (on/off) Makecamp returning on its own \\(meaning any case other than typing in _/makecamp return_\\) will no longer display the \"Arrived at /moveto location\" message Makecamp returning on its own will no longer display halt/pause messages when using breakonkb/mouse or mpause/mousepause since it continually will retry until camp is turned off using /makecamp return still will display the messages Makecamp returning on its own now respects mpause/mousepause and will not try to fight you for returning to the camp Moved toggle and set parameters to their own function mindelay & maxdelay can no longer be used inline as a parameter since they apply to multiple things and this created some problems. instead they are now adjusted with the set parameter \\(any command\\) the minimum for mindelay is still 125, so if you try to set this lower it will default to the plugin default \\(500\\) the minimum value for maxdelay is still mindelay+125, so if you try to set this lower it will set to current mindelay+125 Usage: /stick set mindelay 125 /circle set maxdelay 250 Updated AutoSave to only save if you adjust a setting with toggle or set instead of every time a command is typed since that makes more sense and is less resource intensive Added rswiders' change for bRunNextCommand = true for the 4 main commands \\(followpath still getting overlooked\\) Lowered default camp radius from 100 to 40 LeashLength can now be set = CampRadius in the ini instead of CampRadius+10 Made a new ResetCamp function to reset camp values similar to EndPreviousCmd for the other 3 commands Entering valid parameters followed by an invalid parameter for /stick, /moveto and /circle will no longer output help and continue trying the command, the command will now fail turning a command off or typing a new command that resets a previous command with loose heading will halt the loose heading from trying to finish turning. same applies when using loose moveto when you have arrived at your destination, it will no longer continue turning once it has arrived \\(previously only noticeable in short moveto's\\) /stick toggle spinme for use with /stick front has been removed. This is now set with */stick toggle nohottfront* and saves to the ini under Stick \"AwareNotAggro\" \\(on/off\\) so you only have to type it once if you wish to use it To stay in line with this change, previous \"AggroAwareness\" \\(on/off\\) in the ini renamed to \"AwareAggro\" (*value for the nohott option on/off*) Adding on to the ability to /stick set stucklogic on/off , you can now set more values. \"stuckcheck #\" and \"stuckdist #\", i.e.: /stick set stuckdist 0.001 /moveto set stuckcheck 8 StuckDist, StuckCheck, and TurnIncrement can no longer be set to zero in the ini or via command. If you want to disable stucklogic use /stick set stucklogic off instead You are now able to disable stucklogic's check for if you are facing exactly halfway away from your destination to start turning back the same way it was turning from This is currently only in the INI but will soon be added to the set parameter StuckLogic \"TurnHalfway\" \\(on/off\\) Beta - 8.1101a - CTD fix \u00b6 fix for ctd more checks added to prevent future ctd (*thanks ieatacid & dkaa for help finding the reason: dont call ExecuteCmd to press keys if not in game*) Beta - 8.1030 - minor bugfix \u00b6 Keybinds will no longer interfere with normal gameplay if a command is not active (*or if stick always is on but you do not have a current npc target*) Beta - 8.1029d - sit/stand bug finally gone \u00b6 Changed all references of GetCharInfo to check pCharSpawn \\(which we determine is valid first\\) Fixed circle 'alwaysccw'/drunk/etc & stick alwaysloose values to not reset after one usage ${Stick.Aggro} TLO now returns TRUE/FALSE regardless of if you use the nohott option *(true is determined if you are within the front arc of the target you are facing )* Changed the method of standing up from ExecuteCmd \\(sit\\_stand\\) key to EzCommand \\(\"/stand\"\\) to play nice with MQ2Melee and not offer an opportunity for this plugin to force you to sit down under any circumstance Determined that /circle and breakonsummon math \\(uses breakonwarp math\\) do not play nice together This only affects /circle so don't use breakonsummon with circle for the time being If you are good with math / angles / etc. \\(I'm not\\) and want to help out look at the notes in the To-Do post Fixed loose stick/moveto fighting you for the heading still if using mpause/mousepause/breakonkb/breakonmouse Fixed mpause resuming the command if you pressed down two keys at the same time, such as move forward and right, but only let go of one of them Mousepause now breaks movement since you have to press+hold the right button before the left button to move unless you've got uber micro... In finding the fix for mpause key releases I came up with a solution for mpause leaving you moving fowards even if the key you pressed was strafe_left for example It should now stop all movement and repress whatever key you pressed so that your movement was not interrupted Beta - 8.1029 - new features / misc \u00b6 Fixed the crash bug related to v2008-10-26 Removed redundant check. thanks goes to ascii and dkaa for help in indentifying it. Fixed another potential crash bug. thanks goes to ieatacid for help in identifying it. Another fix attempt at sit/stand bug Added an option for always loose stick now that it uses deadchicken's improved logic. You can turn this option on with /stick toggle alwaysloose just as moveto's has been set with /moveto toggle alwaysloose in a previous update Updated /moveto toggle loose and /stick toggle loose to toggle loose on and off, since supplying it in the command will always turn it on These are independent, meaning if you use /moveto it will not toggle stick's loose, and if you use /stick it will not toggle moveto's loose Identified that on some newer computers \\(it also might relate to duo/quad core cpu\\) that stucklogic even at 0.1 can cause absurd behavior such as random camera angle jerks. deadchicken has some ideas on rewriting this whole process, but for the time being I discovered that if we allow the value to be set to smaller numbers it will improve. On one of my duo core boxes it was always having problems to the point I had to turn it off. I found with setting the value to 0.05 those problems went away and stucklogic worked better It still has problems with the way the math works, it does not properly attempt to work its way around all angles to break from stuck If it reaches exactly the halfway point \\(facing the exact angle away from your target\\) it will start turning back towards the target. This is most noticeable if you are stuck in a corner or doorway To fix the duo-core/faster cpu issues, the value for stucklogic now may be set up to the hundreths The minimum value you can now use in the ini is: 0.001 Added a new \\(long overdue\\) parameter to stick: /stick front If you lose aggro (or use this command on a non-tank to help control push and the mob aggros someone in the rear), you will be spinning endlessly trying to get to the front of the mob By default, if you have access to Health of Target's Target and you are not the target, you will not try to spin with the mob to stay in its front arc For those who do not want that, or for those characters you desire to be in the front arc that will not be the one's on HoTT, you can bypass this with the following toggle: /stick toggle spinme You will then always stick to the front, no matter what, if using /stick front parameter Made major improvements to the NoHoTT aggro detection The way this works is if you are using any arc enforcement other than /stick front (meaning pin , !front , behind ), and you do not have access to Health of Target's Target data, this feature will detect if you are aggro by checking if the mob's heading is pointed towards you If so, it will slide you slightly to the side, and stop for around 7 seconds, then attempt to continue sliding back into position. If the mob is still facing you, it will assume you are aggro, and repeat the process. If the mob is no longer turning with you, you will resume sticking to your prior arc choice * Using /makecamp off will now halt a makecamp return if its currently happening when you issue the off command * Using /makecamp return will no longer work if you do not currently have a camp or camp-player active * Rewrote all WriteChat output to use a new custom function WriteLine, to support the following request * By request, there is a new option added to verbosity, TotalSilence * This can be turned on using /stick set totalsilence on \\(or _/moveto_, _/circle_, and _/makecamp_\\) * This can be turned off using /stick set totalsilence off \\(or _/moveto_, _/circle_, and _/makecamp_\\) * This option will reduce the output to only major events such as the actual toggle itself (totalsilence on, totalsilence off), the help output only if you type '/command help', breakonsummon firing (since it requires you to type '/command imsafe' in order to resume anything), and a few other drastic errors All other output will be suppressed This option saves to the INI and is disabled by default Turning verbosity or fullverbosity back on will disable totalsilence You are no longer allowed to stick to yourself with certain parameters. Sorry for this nerf You can now set your leash length to >= camp radius in the ini, instead of >= campradius + 10 Generic code cleanup and bug fixes Beta - 8.1026 - minor \u00b6 More changes to 'always' stick parameter. Really trying to clean it up a bit more. Fix for my creating a new sit/stand bug by fixing the old one (*setting standstate while dead = bugged until zone out*) Related to above, death should now break all commands except makecamp (*will resume if you get res, but will break if you exit zone*) /stick with invalid parameters will no longer stick Fix for mpause/breakonkb with 'always' Added 'TotalSilence' option to ini that will not display any output except critical errors, breakonsummon notification \\(_since it halts command usage entirely until you turn it off_\\) , and help output if you manually type /stick help Generic code cleanup and bug fixes Beta - 8.1025 - bugfixes \u00b6 Attempted a fix to the long-standing SIT/STAND bug. Major thanks to frostx for supplying me with a ton of information on how to recreate it. Fixed a bug with distance to target not being reset after a stick command was used and ended. this had behavior of sometimes causing breakonwarp messages to fire if the target was outside of breakdist range when you issued a following command. This only applied to certain parameters \\(_i.e. /stick \\#, /stick behind/pin/!front_\\) , and not with anything that set the distance \\(_/stick, /stick on_\\) . Major thanks to frostx for supplying me with a ton of information on how to recreate this so I could find the cause. That's twice! Fixed a crash bug with \"id\" if used with invalid id. \\(_/moveto_ and _/stick_\\) Added Dist and Loose values to /moveto verbosity output Added more checks to prevent stick \"No Target\" error msg instead of halting command attempt if the command requires a target. You will still see the \"You must specify...\" message as normal, but this fix relates to the \"You are now sticking to NO TARGET ERROR\" message Fixed a bug with strafe being held down sometimes, keeping you sliding sideways when you should have stopped Fixed a bug with /stick parameters always checking events for breakonsummon, mpause/mousepause/breakonkb/breakonmouse when you did not have a target. This will now only make those checks if you have a valid npc target and are currently sticking to it Beta - 8.1024 TLO adds / settings rewrite \u00b6 Removed the following TLO members (*${Circle.Summoned}, ${Stick.Summoned}, ${MoveTo.Summoned}, ${Stick.Stuck}, ${MakeCamp.InUseBy}*) Added a new TLO ${MoveUtils} with the following members: ${MoveUtils.Stuck} - TRUE / FALSE - \\(former stick.stuck\\) ${MoveUtils.Summoned} - TRUE / FALSE \\(former everything.summoned\\) ${MoveUtils.Command} - NONE / STICK / CIRCLE / MOVETO / MAKECAMP this is the replacement for makecamp.inuseby MAKECAMP will only show up if nothing else active if you have makecamp on and stick active, STICK will be the result ${MoveUtils} returns this same information ${MoveUtils.StuckLogic} - TRUE / FALSE \\(if you have stuck logic on or not\\) ${MoveUtils.Verbosity} - TRUE / FALSE \\(if you have verbosity on or not\\) ${MoveUtils.FullVerbosity} - TRUE / FALSE \\(if you have fullverbosity on or not\\) Added new members to ${Circle} TLO for those of you who prefer true / false: ${Circle.Clockwise} - TRUE / FALSE \\(circle.rotation still shows CW/CCW\\) ${Circle.Backwards} - TRUE / FALSE \\(circle.direction still shows FORWARDS/BACKWARDS\\) BreakOnSummon no longer fires if only makecamp is on. it will fire if makecamp is attempting to return to camp though since that turns moveto on, which is checked Added the same fix from the previous posts for turn-walk-off adjustment to mouse pause as well. breakonmouse did not have this problem, only pause In the process of changing the syntax of anything that toggles to be able to be toggled as well as set via on / off. I'll also be adding the ability to set just about anything that should be modifiable using this same foundation. This already is a major change to the syntax of most every toggle I've added so please take note: The help output doesnt reflect any of this yet. Where /command can be \\(/stick, /moveto, /circle, /makecamp\\) //The same as before /command help /command debug /command pause /command unpause /command save /command load /command imsafe //Different: \"set\" - this is just a basic foundation /command set verbosity on|off /command set fullverbosity on|off /command set stucklogic on|off //Different: \"toggle\" - this is used to toggle values /command toggle mpause /command toggle mousepause /command toggle breakonkb /command toggle breakonmouse /command toggle autosave /command toggle feign /command toggle autopause /command toggle advancedautopause <---still doesnt work any better dont bother using really /command toggle stucklogic /command toggle verbosity /command toggle fullverbosity /command toggle nohott /command toggle hidehelp /command toggle breakongate /command toggle breakonwarp /command toggle alwaysdrunk /command toggle alwaysbackwards /command toggle alwaysccw /command toggle alwaysloose <---this only applies to moveto atm /command toggle breakonsummon /command checkifstuck is forever removed. use toggle stucklogic or set stucklogic on\\|off Preserved the values for 'ArrivalDist' and 'MoveToMod' in the ini since they were defaulting back to plugin-default values instead of your own custom settings. Will apply this to most everything else in the near future. Fixed mpause resuming no command if makecamp was active by itself. it should still resume an interrupted return to camp. Beta - 8.1023 - minor \u00b6 Added \"Stuck\" TLO ${Stick.Stuck} - FALSE / TRUE - (true if stucklogic detects you are stuck Added a turn off walking adjustment to BreakOnKB to fix a bug with walk being left on Beta - 8.1019 - cleanup \u00b6 StuckLogic fixed. I loaded a session running old source and one running beta source side by side on 2 screens and it behaves the same way on both. Its sloppy and could use work but it was not functioning at all before so now it functions like its used to. I used the preferred settings posted earlier in the thread so please report any differences on other settings. The TurnIncrement of 10 seems to take forever to unstick in tight areas (hallways, small indoor rooms), so I upped it for myself to much better results around 35.0, you may want to try a higher value here if you use this indoors. outdoors might only need small increments StuckLogic now turns on walk when its stuck also, to help reduce getting unstuck only to get restuck because of a burst of speed in hallways and tight corners /stick loose - now uses deadchicken's /moveto loose improvements this will now spin before moving if the heading to the target is greater than \u00bc a turn this should be much more functional and cut down quite a large amount of the orbiting and getting stuck due to loose sticking after playing with it for a good hour in multiple situations, I can say it looks much more natural than before and could be used viably in situations where the fast facing would not be acceptable. test it out by adding 'loose' anywhere in your normal command line for /stick *Drunken circle still needs to be looked at because circle and stucklogic are having issues when you turn on circle next to a wall, which I don't know why you'd ever do that, but the circle gets stuck running forward indefinately \\(in both versions of the source it looks like\\) so I need to track that down before bringing circle over to the new loose logic* * Added /moveto toggle loose - to turn off loose without moving, since /moveto loose always forces it on Beta - 8.1018 - cleanup \u00b6 Fixed a bug with /stick uw | underwater not working BreakOnSummon now applies to all commands, not just /stick Updated BreakOnSummon to be more assertive. If BreakOnSummon fires, it will prevent any future command usage in case your macro continually reissues a /stick, /circle or /moveto command When this fires this will display a warning message and notify you There is now a new parameter to reset this, /stick imsafe , which will allow command usage once again For macros that may continually trigger BreakOnSummon, but you still want to use it, there are new TLOs: ${Stick.Summoned} ${Circle.Summoned} ${MoveTo.Summoned} - TRUE / FALSE These apply across the board, meaning they all will be true or they all will be false, so use whichever you like. So in theory if you know something is going to fire breakonsummoned but you still want to use it for other cases, you could issue the command, check the state of the TLO and then have your macro issue a /stick imsafe to undo the command halting BreakOnSummon defaults to false now instead of true since its more assertive Fixed a bug with BreakOnWarp where if you have a camp setup and you issued a /stick or /moveto it would report that mob had warped out of range when the mob never really moved to begin with. If you are leashed you should still not be able to go to the mob, just for different reasons Renamed TurnDirection \\(ini setting\\) to TurnIncrement to be more appropriate for what it actually does. Thanks to deadchicken, /moveto loose is improved. There is now an additional check comparing your current heading to the heading you want to go to, and if its larger than a \u00bc turn, you will spin before you begin moving instead of trying to spin while moving. This prevents the endless \"orbiting\" in circles without ever being able to reach your destination LooseMoveTo in the ini \\(always use loose when using _/moveto_\\) now defaults to true because this is really superior now, and you should use this to prevent the fast facing that goes on if its false. It is very noticeable and detectable. Should you still want the fast facing, then you can either set LooseMoveTo to 'off' in the ini, or type /moveto toggle alwaysloose to toggle it off, then issue a /moveto save to save it to your ini as well /moveto toggle alwaysloose is restricted to the /moveto command, and doesnt work if you use /stick or /circle . I plan to keep them command-based in the future as well Starting to add more comments to the source for those of you trying to learn how it works Beta - 8.1015a - breakonsummon \u00b6 Added a new feature, BreakOnSummon This command works like BreakOnWarp except it checks the distance change of your own x / y locations from pulse to pulse, not related to the mob If your own x / y changes too drastically, with this enabled it will halt all commands. This is useful for COH, or mob summon \\(though I guess not if to the mob you are sticking\\) , but more important if you are summoned by those invisible people in short distances where breakonwarp normally wouldn't fire due to what they do, small repeated summons, doesnt matter with the large distance check you want to use for mob-warp checking. this one you can safely set to a small amount and not worry about your stick breaking from mobs warping small distances the default is set to 20 soas not to interfere with summon from mob you are stuck to, but it may need to be set smaller to be effective, or larger if the mobs you fight you get summoned more than 20 range. it seems the max you move onpulse is around 2.0 with runspeed5, but bard or mount may be higher than that Added new INI settings for this Stick 'BreakOnSummon' - on / off Stick 'BreakSummonDist' - distance to consider summoned \\(default 20.0\\) Added toggle: /stick toggle breakonsummon Related to this, I fixed a since-inception bug with breakonwarp that only worked on half of the angles from your mob. the math \\(if sqrt\\(yourdist\\) - sqrt \\(mob dist\\) > breakdist) never worked when the differences were negative. now they do. Beta - 8.1015 - pause logic \u00b6 mpause, if set to ON, will now apply to mouselook as well. you can mouselook or mouselook+left click to move around and it will return based on min/max delay if mpause is set OFF, unlike pressing a key, mouselook will not break your command it will no longer fight with you for the heading. it will allow you to move with the mouse but once you let go of mouselook it will resume the previous command immediately. /stick toggle mousepause this works independently of mpause now. its optional and works identically to mpause for keyboard movement. it saves to the ini as MousePause as well. if turned on, any movement of the mouse while mouselook (turn head with right-click-hold only, or move by right-click-hold plus left-click) will pause the command and return after the min/max delays. if its turned off it will behave like it always did and fight with you for the heading if you try to do anything. to overcome that there is now another option * /stick toggle breakonmouse * this works like mpause=off used to work for keyboard movement * if you move the mouse while a command is active, it will break from the command altogether * you can set this under Defaults 'BreakOnMouse' in the ini * /stick toggle breakonkb * this works like mpause=off used to * mpause=off will not break from your current commands any longer, it will resume immediately as opposed to with a delay, and fight you for the keyboard. you need to set breakonkb or \\(BreakOnKB in the ini\\) the way you like it breakonkb will default to true since this was the old default behavior Pause and break turn each other off, but do not turn the others on. You can have mpause and breakonkb both off, but breakonkb on = mpause off and mpause on = breakonkb off. If you like and use mpause, but decided to try breakonkb, then turned breakonkb off, mpause needs to be turned back on trying to turn both true in the ini will result in breaks being off and pauses being on. ManualPause changed to KeyboardPause in the ini. command still is mpause though. Fixed a bug with /makecamp on \\# /makecamp radius and /makecamp on \\# and /makecamp player and /makecamp y x commands now also enforce leash size update if leash is smaller than camp radius \\(before only /makecamp with no params did this\\) Put the stick dir \\(normal\\) dist \\(\\#\\) mod \\(\\#\\) hold \\(no\\) loose \\(no\\) msg on verbosity instead of fullverbosity Failing to input a command-specific parameter correctly will no longer issue help for the entire plugin, only the command it relates to. Typing '/command help' if HideHelp option is on now assumes you wanted the display and will output the help one time instead of blocking it in this case. Beta - 8.1014 - TLO adds \u00b6 Added New TLOs: ${Stick.DistMod} - value set with /stick mod # or /stick -# ${Stick.DistModPercent} - value set with /stick #% ${Stick.Always} - PAUSED / TRUE / FALSE - \\(true if '/stick \\[parameters\\] always' was activated\\) ${Stick.Aggro} - PAUSED / TRUE / FALSE - \\(true if NoHoTT detects aggro\\) Help output completed, hence the new hidehelp option since it is spamcity INI Revamp - ini file now breaks down into logical sections Defaults Stick Circle MoveTo MakeCamp StuckLogic your-char-name INI file supports many more features. I suggest you backup your current one and delete it, then log in game and /stick save to output a new one. Then edit in your old values from backup and save the file and then /stick load. That way you can see all the new features organized correctly. Loading all values from Defaults will no longer work in this version, but some still remain there. New INI Options Defaults 'HideHelp' - never display spam-filled help syntax Stick 'AwareAggro' - NoHoTT checking on/off Stick 'StickDistMod' - always use specific dist mod Stick 'StickDistModPercent' - always use specific dist mod percent MoveTo 'ArrivalDist' - max dist from moveto loc that is acceptable MoveTo 'LooseMoveTo' - always use loose heading MoveTo 'MoveToMod' - always use specific moveto dist mod Circle 'AlwaysBackwards' - always run backwards Circle 'AlwaysCounterClockwise' - always run in a counter-clockwise circle Circle 'AlwaysDrunken' - always use drunken movement Circle 'RadiusSize' - always use specific radius size New primary command parameters \\(_usable with /stick, /moveto, /makecamp, or /circle_\\) : /stick toggle hidehelp - toggle hidehelp on/off /stick toggle breakongate - toggle on/off /stick toggle breakonwarp - toggle on/off /circle toggle alwaysdrunk - toggle default to drunken /circle toggle alwaysbackwards - toggle default to backwards /circle toggle alwaysccw - toggle default to counterclockwise issue a '/stick save' afterwards to write these changes to ini if desired Experimental new command : '/stick advancedautopause' this will attempt to turn on walk, stop moving, turn to the right to force a position update to prevent casting while moving from getting interrupted. i dont know how well it will work or not, since the current implementation only is good for stopping you from moving if already stationary then casting. *this doesnt work, need a better way to check if casting before the bar pops up* Beta - 8.1013 - minor \u00b6 My attempt to fix the negative stick/movedist halting movement broke the mod applied and forced a very close stick value. Fixed this. You can now set the modifier independently. This will not turn stick on or modify current stick, just change the base value. Before you had to set the mod with: /stick -5 This would subtract 5 from whatever value you used (or mob melee range, which i believe is the intention of this whole thing) every time. It defaulted to 0, but once you set it, you were stuck with negative forever. - Now using */stick mod \\[#\\]*, you can: - reset it to zero (*/stick mod 0*) - or use a positive number (*/stick mod 5* would make */stick 10* function as */stick 15*. This will defeat the purpose of melee range checking but would be good for increasing the number for macros that use too small of number or something along those lines. It is there if you can find a use for it. Added output for modchanges without any verbosity check \\(will move it to Verbosity once its all correct\\) so you can see these actions taking place. FullVerbosity also displays the mod on every use of /stick. Added toggle for Verbosity option Added toggle for FullVerbosity option Beta - 8.1012a - minor \u00b6 Added Circle TLOs \\([string]()\\) - ${Circle} - ON / OFF / PAUSED \\([string]()\\) - ${Circle.Status} - ON / OFF/ PAUSED \\([float](../../../reference/data-types/datatype-float.md)\\) - ${Circle.CircleX} - location of the center X \\([float](../../../reference/data-types/datatype-float.md)\\) - ${Circle.CircleY} - location of the center Y \\([bool](../../../reference/data-types/datatype-bool.md)\\) - ${Circle.Drunken} - TRUE / FALSE \\([string]()\\) - ${Circle.Rotation} - CW / CCW \\([string]()\\) - ${Circle.Direction} - FORWARDS / BACKWARDS Added the ability to change circle radius Before you had to re-issue /circle on \\# to change the radius \\(size\\) of the circle. This would plant the anchor where you were at, forcing you to reset any custom anchor or options. Now you can do this: /circle radius \\# - will keep circling but increase the radius on the fly Removed the ability to do /moveto dist/-dist because it was having conflicts. To set the moveto distance now you need to use: /moveto dist \\# - to set distance /moveto dist -dist - to subtract from currently set distance You can no longer set stick or moveto distance to a value below 0. Negative numbers halted all movement so any attempt to do so will force the distance value to 1. Beta - 8.1012 - makecamp player \u00b6 Fixed two more crash bugs \\(thanks ieatacid\\) Added /makecamp player name Makecamp player works if you supply a valid name of a PC in the zone uses your current target \\(fails if target is not SPAWN\\_PLAYER\\) if you do not supply the name. This will create a dynamic camp based on the location of this player as they move, using the current 'radius' and 'leash' values that you are used to. This works like a ghetto autofollow and actually appears somewhat natural because it uses moveto logic instead of stick logic. This means no fast/loose facing the person, just moving to their general area \\(which is cool\\) . If the camp is based around your puller, that is a bad idea, don't do it. If the person you supply is really far away when you issue the command, it may have trouble getting to them. If the person magically warps/gets summoned way far away, it will likely have problems. Also note this still uses the mindelay and maxdelay values for deciding when to move, so it will look like you are really two/three/four/etc-boxing and moving them if you set the values correctly. The downside to this is that if the character is on the very edge of the leash length and you are taking small steps forward it will take its own small steps forward as well, based on the min/max delays, so that can look weird Beta - 8.1011 - minor \u00b6 attempt a fix at a crash bug related to verbosity output. Went through the whole source and that was the only time the writechat was used incorrectly in that way Please report any occurrences of new \"NULL POINTER ERROR\" message or new \"NO TARGET\" error message (both relate to only the verbose output for /stick) and how to reproduce it The old NULL POINTER message still exists as it always did in original moveutils Beta - 8.1002 - complete rewrite \\(first beta\\) \u00b6 Command Syntax - Many base commands all can be used from every command i.e. /circle load, /stick load, /makecamp load, /moveto load - all will do the same thing * INI File - many more settings supported INI File Verbosity - Changed from 1/0 to on/off. It will auto-correct old files, so you dont need to mess with it. Just a FYI. Output - drastically changed, may break macro events \\(tried to keep the most common ones the same\\) Issuing one command completely ends the other - This does not apply to /makecamp, only /circle, /moveto, and /stick Feign Support - added feign parameter or FeignSupport in the INI. When enabled this will not begin your command if you are FD until you manually stand up * AutoSave - automatically save ini like old save cmd \\(/stick save\\) every time you change a setting New TLOs \\([string]()\\) - ${MakeCamp.InUseBy} - which command is active \\([string]()\\) - ${Stick.StickTargetName} - name of stick target if using /stick id, or /stick hold, otherwise will be target name/NONE * Additional Verbosity - fullverbosity option \\(ini file\\) to output more detailed information. original verbosity still exists and fullverbosity does NOT turn on original stick verbosity messages. you have to set each independently * StuckLogic Toggle - added a toggle for stucklogic, no longer need to reload ini file * AutoPause Toggle - added a toggle for autopause, no longer need to reload ini file * New Stick Parameter 'always' - Usage: /stick [other parameters] always Putting 'always' at the end will not require another /stick after you lose your target \\(i.e. mob dies\\) . This behaves the same way as if you /stick something, then change the target before it dies which uses the same settings as the last time you typed the command. This does not work with stick hold or stick id. This only works with NPC targets \\(not their pets\\) , so changing to other target types like PC, chest, corpse, etc. will not make you run around constantly. This works great if you pass targets with EQBC for example. Using this on your puller or when cross-zone targeting will probably cause you problems. This setting cannot be saved and will reset upon any new command typed by design because of its potential misuse. Don't ask for huge features on this. I can see it being used carelessly so be careful. * Check for aggro if you dont have HoTT - this is experimental and still needs improvement Original - 8.0913 - first moveutils change \u00b6 every 'break' function that used this method to stop moving seems to be failing: MQ2Globals::ExecuteCmd(FindMappableCommand(\"forward\"),0,0); Changed the ExecuteCmds to supply a down then up to stop the issue: MQ2Globals::ExecuteCmd(FindMappableCommand(\"forward\"),1,0); MQ2Globals::ExecuteCmd(FindMappableCommand(\"forward\"),0,0);","title":"MQ2MoveUtils:v11 Revisions"},{"location":"plugins/community-plugins/mq2moveutils/mq2moveutils-v11-revisions/#mq2moveutilsv11-revisions","text":"__FORCETOC__","title":"MQ2MoveUtils:v11 Revisions"},{"location":"plugins/community-plugins/mq2moveutils/mq2moveutils-v11-revisions/#mq2moveutils-v160-revision-history","text":"","title":"MQ2MoveUtils v16.0 Revision History"},{"location":"plugins/community-plugins/mq2moveutils/mq2moveutils-v11-revisions/#patch-fix-for-16-nov-2016","text":"Applied changes necessary because of the Nov 16 th 2016 patch. \\(trevyn\\)","title":"Patch Fix for 16-Nov-2016"},{"location":"plugins/community-plugins/mq2moveutils/mq2moveutils-v11-revisions/#made-in-notepad-only-v160717","text":"brainiac loves the D Fixed this bad code, a bug in the source for years that has always been wrong","title":"Made in Notepad only - v16.0717"},{"location":"plugins/community-plugins/mq2moveutils/mq2moveutils-v11-revisions/#stable-v140416","text":"Added Circle Strafe Ability \\(Cr4zyb4rd\\) /stick strafe \\[left\\|right\\|flip\\|random ] Continuously strafes in one direction regardless of distance to target with no target-of-target check. left|right - direction to strafe flip - strafes in opposite direction of last strafe command random - strafe direction chosen by luck I've found using /stick strafe flip 50 moveback loose lets me bow-kite a snared mob in a pretty tight circle, and I can just hit the same key again if I get too close to a wall or something and need to change direction.

You may switch over by using: /stick set wineq on This saves to the ini under Defaults as WinEQ=on/off The true movement ability no longer makes the plugin offset-dependent. In the event the offset pattern changes and true movement is not established, the plugin should revert to the old style of movement so there would be no downtime or need to downgrade while waiting for an update. Heading settings are no longer command/INI situational. It applies to the plugin across the board. You may still apply inline adjustments for single command use only. To change plugin default headings, use: /stick set heading true /stick set heading loose /stick set heading fast saves to the ini under Defaults Heading and character-specific section All commands now reset to INI \\(user, not plugin\\) defaults after each use. The INI no longer reloads every time you zone. It will only unload and reload defaults if you use the 'load' parameter \\(ie /stick load\\) or if you camp to character select and re-enter world. Loading the INI file will end commands in progress. Command parameters applied inline will no longer overwrite INI defaults. To change INI defaults, use 'set' or 'toggle' to make changes permanent. The ability to use most INI settings inline has been added. This allows you to issue a command with the setting inline to apply it to the current command, and once the command has ended the next command will revert back to the INI defaults. As an example, if your snaproll default distance was 10.0 and you wanted to make your snaproll distance larger for a single mob, you could: /stick snaproll rear snapdist 20.0 ...and this would snaproll 20 distance behind the target.

This command will effectively lock your character in place until you turn it off with \"/rootme off\", preventing you via the keyboard or the plugin or /keypress from moving you forward. I figured this was within the scope of the plugin and may have some uses such as macro-based GM detection, or eqbc command passing for a character that is about to do something problematic. With rootme active, other commands will not work until you turn it off - though a makecamp on may still fight with it so consider this experimental for now. Added BreakOnTarget option to '/stick', which will break from the current stick if your target changes. /stick set breakontarget on, saves to the INI under Stick BreakOnTarget=on/off Added AlwaysUW options to both stick and moveto \\(individually\\) . the current AutoUW option turns on underwater adjustments automatically only when you are underwater \\(as intended\\) . The new 'alwaysuw' setting will instead always perform the stick or moveto as if you had typed 'uw' inline somewhere. /stick set alwaysuw on, /moveto set alwaysuw on, saves to the INI under Stick AlwaysUW=on/off && MoveTo AlwaysUW=on/off Added 'strafewalk' option to stick. This turns on walking when you are close to the target and using a strafe-based stick parameter. For characters with ridiculously high run speed this will help you position more accurately and should assist background sessions with moving slower and not overshooting the destination. /stick set strafewalk on, ini Stick UseWalk=on/off Added 'usefleeing' option to stick for 'stick front'. If the target is fleeing \\(same check as the TLO\\) and under 25% health, stick front will not attempt to strafe and reposition in front of the target. This is still experimental. Added 'useback' to moveto. Just like with stick, if you are close to the moveto destination (which also includes camp returns), this will walk backwards to the destination rather than turning, facing the destination, walking there, and turning again. /moveto set useback on, ini: MoveTo UseBack=on/off Set the distance same way as stick \\(though unlike stick, you probably want a larger value here\\) /moveto set backupdist # \\(1.0 min\\) . moveto and stick save their own distances, not use the same. Added 'realtimeplayer' setting to camp returning. Previous '/makecamp player' behavior set the location of the player, and began moving there. if the player moved during that time, it would walk to the old location first and then begin moving again. realtimeplayer now makes the positions dynamic and will adjust a return on the fly. i made this optional in case anyone used that as some form of ghetto advpath. /makecamp set realtimeplayer on BreakOnGM now displays a timestamp for zone in & zone out times. if you see one blink in and out within a matter of seconds, they went invis and you should not consider yourself safe. Bug Fixes & Cleanup HideHelp now functions as the output message describes instead of in reverse. '/stick front' will no longer take the 'long way' around the mob to get back into position. Rewrote the UI window class to fix several bugs. Stripped the command history & output box from the UI window. The UI window should remain up when you are hovering When triggered, BreakOnGM & BreakOnSummon will prevent future commands from being used and output a message, rather than allow the commands to be accepted but then the plugin does nothing. ReturnHaveTarget, ReturnNoAggro, and ReturnNotLooting will now all perform their checks so that if you have multiple options enabled, one will not prevent the other from taking place. Changed the randomize formula a bit, though it may not have helped any. Setting the behindarc setting will actually take effect. Stucklogic should be less aggressive if a character is walking AutoPause will no longer apply if only makecamp is active and not returning Fixed the stick healer / uw parameter bug '/calcangle' has more data added to the output stick commands should no longer cause the character to run in circles around the target (noticeably taking a while to correct itself) if you turned it on when close to the target and facing certain angles. delaystrafe should now work exactly as intended / problem free, and i suggest using it always, especially for those who do not regularly have HOTT data mousepause & mpause will no longer try to resume when the plugin was paused by the user \\(ie /stick pause\\) if you ditch your stick target while mpause / mousepause is in effect, the plugin will take note instantly instead of waiting the normal delay time and then attempting to resume followed by breaking later pause/breakonkb \\(with true movement\\) should not interfere with your keypresses unless your ubermicro beats the speed of the threading. for mpause if you are using the oldstyle movement it will still behave as it did before (if you hold down two keys and let one go, the timer starts from the first key even though you still have the second key held). a bug with zoning while a pause was active causing keybinds movement to be broken while the plugin was loaded has been fixed \\(rare case\\)","title":"\\(when used with stick, this applies to delaystrafe\\) maxdelay # \\(when used with stick, this applies to delaystrafe\\)"},{"location":"plugins/community-plugins/mq2moveutils/mq2moveutils-v11-revisions/#development-90608-verbosity-rewrite-stick-healer-breakongm","text":"Rewrote the verbosity system to be based off bit flags. This allows the user full control of every message that will or will not be displayed by the plugin. Read this wiki entry for the flags table and details on how it works, and what specific messages are tied to what bit flags. I have converted the old system, so if the new system is a bit confusing, verbosity , fullverbosity , autopauseoutput , and totalsilence still work very close to as before. I have not updated the wiki yet with the new commands, Usage: /stick verbflags - Lists your current verbosity bit flags (useful for knowing what to add/subtract from if you want to make a single change) /stick set verbflags # - Sets your verbosity flags to # (where # is the total sum of whatever flags you added up, check the wiki link) note: if you set # to 0 or a negative number, it is equivalent to totalsilence Numerical flags value saves to the INI under [Defaults] as \"VerbosityFlags\" and to [server.char] section as well. The totalsilence option now applies to everything, and not 'almost everything'. Added a new verbosity toggle so that you do not have to memorize 33554431, and may use */stick toggle totalverbosity* to turn on every message possible. Added a new safety option, BreakOnGM. This works similar to BreakOnSummon. When active, it will scan OnAddSpawn for a GM type zoning in. If a visible GM/Guide does zone in, the plugin will halt any active MoveUtils commands and prevent future MoveUtils command usage until you unlock it \\(same command as BreakOnSummon - _/stick imsafe_\\) . I highly recommend you turn on the verbosity bit flags for this if you are using this feature, as otherwise you may wonder why your commands are not working. Usage: /stick toggle breakongm Saves to the INI under [Defaults] as \"BreakOnGM\" Added a new TLO member ${MoveUtils.GM}, which returns TRUE if the GM detection has fired and the plugin is currently locked. Added a new stick type, /stick healer . **This does not work with any custom angles (pin, front, !front, behind, behindonce, snaproll).** This is useful for those who may wish to stick their healer to another group member to keep them following without having them look like they are sticking. **The main difference of this stick type is that until the character is out of stick range, it will not perform any heading adjustments**. For example, currently if you stick your healer to your tank, every time the tank moves the healer would turn to be facing directly at the tank and it is very noticeable. With /stick healer , you can issue a command such as /stick 100 hold healer and as long as your healer is within 100 range of the tank, it will sit still and not turn at all. Once the tank moves beyond 100 range, the healer would then turn to face it and move until it is within 100 range again. If you keep autopause off, targeting yourself while sticking will now halt your movement until you target something else \\(unless you are using stick id/hold\\) . AutoPause on includes this functionality, but if you have it off and switched from an NPC to yourself with moveback enabled, previously you would try to move away from yourself, backing up forever. This displays a message as well, and is tied to the Autopause verbosity flag. Unducking will now also use /stand instead of hitting the duck key, which in very rare cases would also cause a server desync. WTB /stand as a native EQ mappable key. The fullverbosity message for stick will no longer display the mod output unless you actually have a mod active. The fullverbosity message for stick now will reflect HEALER if /stick healer is used.

All moveto \\(including 'id'\\) and camp returns once again use GetDistance except the special case of /moveto y x z.

Please let me know if there are still cases where the \"spinning\" happens as I may not have got them all. Fixed an issue with stucklogic attempting to get unstuck when it was not. Stucklogic when underwater should no longer almost always think it is stuck. The current formula may not be tight enough so you may run into cases where stucklogic will not get unstuck while underwater. This will need more tweaking in the future. For now, this prevents the endless spinning when underwater. Stucklogic will no longer try to jump when underwater if TryToJump is enabled. Added a new option AutoUW which will automatically turn on underwater face angle adjustments when fully underwater. This will affect moveto and stick commands when active and the plugin detects you are underwater and you have a target. This is enabled by default. If you frequently use /moveto or /makecamp while underwater and having a target unrelated to your destination, you may want to disable this option. Usage: /stick toggle autouw Saves to the INI as AutoUW under Defaults and server.char sections. The /moveto loc command now accepts an optional Z axis.

This only applies to /moveto id or if the Z axis is supplied in the /moveto loc Y X z format. This will not affect precisey, precisex, or camp returns. Moveto now accepts the uw and underwater parameters, which will adjust your face angle based on the height and location of your current target.

You may adjust the value with: /stick set allowmove # \\(e.g. /stick set allowmove 64.0 \\) Saves to the INI as AllowMove under Defaults and server.char sections. TurnRate cap has been increased from 24.0 to 100.0, though I wouldn't suggest going that high. the pause parameter, and kb/mouse break/pause will now halt heading adjustments for loose/true heading (previously seen example: typing /stick pause and seeing your heading still finish the rotation afterward) gFaceAngle will now be reset by the plugin if moveto, circle, or stick is active (meaning you cannot use /face during those cases). Hitting turn left/right with breakonkb/mpause will once again allow you to continue turning UseBack defaults to false instead of true Added output for GetDistance and GetDistance3D to the /calcangle command. (Able to see the differences in distance to help set arrivaldist values based on your usage)","title":"Development - 9.0419 - bug fixes, uw enhancement"},{"location":"plugins/community-plugins/mq2moveutils/mq2moveutils-v11-revisions/#development-90412-major-release","text":"All movement is now tied directly to the variables used by eqgame. This plugin now uses self-finding offsets, though they are no different than the current __RunWalkState type of offset provided in the main compile. This has allowed me to end the over-compensation needed to stop movement and prevent the shooting off into the distance that plagued the original version. In testing, movement is less choppy and more accurate than ever before. As an extra precaution, I also have made the applicable keyboard flags reflect being pressed \\(like MQ2's keybinds do\\) while any movement is active. YOU MAY NEED TO READJUST YOUR STUCKLOGIC SETTINGS Along with this comes a new feature, \"true heading\". This uses the actual turn left and turn right movement keys to perform heading adjustments. This is enabled by default as loose heading was before. If you do not wish to use this, you may /stick toggle alwaystruehead to turn it off for good. By using actual turning, the turnspeed multiplier and heading change increments are now 100% legit. Loose heading logic is still provided for those who want to go quasi-legit with a custom turn increment, and fast heading is the same as before. Note if you disabled loose heading because you want fast heading, you will now also need to disable true heading. When enabled (again, it is on by default) it will apply to stick and moveto both, not separately like loose heading works. Ways to use this: /stick ____ truehead _- usable inline with any other parameters /stick toggle truehead - toggle truehead for current command in process /stick toggle alwaystruehead - toggle using it always Saves to INI as TrueHeading under Defaults . This also saves to the character-specific setting if _savebychar is turned on. Added an optional strafe delay timer to prevent instant strafing when mobs turn for a short period of time such as quick spells, or gaining aggro without HoTT. Consider this, properly configured, a replacement to the old nohott and a fix to an issue reported by LrdDread. Ways to use this: /stick toggle delaystrafe - turns the delay for strafe-based movement \\(pin, !front, front, behind\\) on or off /stick set strafemindelay # - sets the minimum amount of time you wish to delay before strafing \\(in miliseconds\\) . The default is 1500 \\(1.5 seconds\\) . /stick set strafemaxdelay # - sets the maximum amount of time you wish to wait before strafing \\(in miliseconds\\) . The default is 3000 \\(3 seconds\\) . Saves to the INI under Stick as DelayStrafe, and StrafeMinDelay / StrafeMaxDelay. The size of the arc for /stick !front is now configurable by the user. You may use: /stick set !frontarc # - Valid ranges 260.0 to 1.0. The default is 135.0 and if you do not adjust it, it will continue to behave like normal. Saves to the INI as NotFrontArc under Stick . This also saves to the character-specific setting if savebychar is turned on. Implemented optional arc randomization for pin/!front/behind. You may enable this with /stick toggle randomize . My formula is pretty basic so it will not be anything special yet, but its a foundation for improvement in the next release down the road. This saves to the INI as RandomArc under Stick , and if you have fullverbosity enabled then behind/!front will also output their arc values to the chatwnd. Added a command, /calcangle , which dumps the value moveutils uses to determine angular dist (useful if you want to configure your !front arc) or know what the randomization values represent. When rewriting loose heading I had inadvertently disabled a feature of the original MoveUtils. With loose heading enabled: when very close to your target it would walk backwards to stick instead of turning to face the target, moving into stick position, and turning to face the target again. This is now enabled by default . I noticed in some cases it can end up causing your character to move in crazy-eight style patterns, and adjusted the math to correct this. Using moveback in your stick commands overcomes that problem with ease, but if you do not like to use moveback and/or run into that problem often, please report a solid way of recreating it here and then consider turning it off based on your play style. Unlike the old moveutils, I have made this feature optional. Ways to use this: /stick toggle useback - turns the backwards walking on and off /stick set backupdist # - how close to the target you can be to use backward walking. The smaller the better . This defaults to 10.0 like the old moveutils Saves to INI as UseBackward and BackupDist under Stick Snaproll now uses GetDistance3D to prevent certain bugs related to being unable to get in range of a target on large slopes. I have left the old line in place so if you have any issues with snaprolls, you may uncomment the old line and comment out the new one \\(fGetSnapDist around line 4100\\) Snaproll now sets the final heading adjustment before handling control back over to normal stick. AutoPause now has an optional message output, so you can have greater awareness of why your character is suddenly standing still doing nothing. You may enable/disable this with /stick toggle autopauseoutput . If this is enabled, it will not respect totalsilence so you will need to configure this on its own. This saves to the INI as AutoPauseMsg under Defaults . MoveTo now has two new BreakOn options \\(my implementation of a suggestion from dkaa\\) . They are different forms of detecting aggro during a /moveto that will halt the command. This mostly assists macro writers in being able to stop moving to a location and handle the event of getting aggro during the move. Ways to use this: /moveto toggle breakonaggro - this will halt the moveto if you gain aggro \\(crossed-swords indicator\\) /moveto toggle breakonhit - this will halt the moveto if you are swung at \\(both contact or miss\\) , if you want to keep moving until something is actually trying to hit you. I have added support for all three types of hitmodes, though if you use the \"number only\", I am only parsing for misses not the numerics and you are annoying to support . If you wish to use this, you should consider switching to abbreviated or normal. Saves to the INI under BreakOnAggro and BreakOnHit under MoveTo . In the event either of these trigger: A new TLO member, ${MoveTo.Broken} will show as true, so that you may see if the event fired. This will not reset to false until the next time you issue a /moveto command. - An output message will display to the chatwnd \\(if you do not have _totalsilence_ enabled\\) Fixed a problem with the /stick pin formula on one side of the target not positioning correctly. Camp returns and moveto's now resume after pausing the plugin and unpausing with /stick pause|unpause . Mousepause will no longer spam if the pause flips active with only a makecamp setup and attempting to auto-return. Makecamp will no longer try to return while mouselook movement is active. Once the return begins and you attempt to use the mouse though it still will not let you, so if you use mouselook movement often consider turning on mousepause or breakonmouse. BreakOnGate has been switched from OnIncomingChat to a Blech event. Please report if this does not work as intended. Bard detection has switched from string parsing to numeric comparison. It will now only check once every time you type a command \\(to support switching to shrouds with the plugin loaded\\) instead of OnPulse. If you switch to a shroud with stick active, please stab yourself and then you will need to end the command and restart it to detect the class change. ReturnNoTarget has been renamed to ReturnHaveTarget , as the naming incorrectly implied the opposite of what it actually does. The command is also updated: /makecamp toggle returnhavetarget . Loose \\(yes/no\\) output in fullverbosity has been changed to Head \\(true/loose/fast\\) MakeCamp Leash and Delay value output has been slightly modified. Fixed some cases where BreakOnWarp and BreakOnSummon would incorrectly fire \\(mainly due to mpause/mousepause\\) and cleaned up the logic. Removed nohott \\(AwareAggro in the INI\\) as it has been nothing but problematic. Removed the MQ2Melee /mutils output Renamed the keybinds, so you may want to cleanup your MacroQuest.ini after loading this. Nerfed the ability to /stick id # to your mount.

Stucklogic uses new values for a new formula written by deadchicken. This formula calculates your pulse averages based on a table, with greater accuracy than before. The new values are configured as such: /stick set pulsecheck # pulsecheck defaults to 4 this value is sort of what \"stuckcheck\" was before. it serves as the size of your pulse history to be used to calculate your average movement distance. the largest you can set this value to is 32 \\(defined by MAXRINGSIZE\\) . The higher you set this number, the less often stucklogic would misfire \\(so if you are getting the \"jittery\" problem you will want to increase this value\\) . This also means it will take longer to know that it is stuck, so if you are getting stuck and not responding fast enough, you would do the opposite and lower this value. /stick set pulseunstuck # - pulseunstuck defaults to 5 - this value is new - this is the amount of pulses you have successfully moved forward before hard-forcing stucklogic to be considered unstuck. this serves the purpose in that if you were stuck for 20 pulses, your stuck counter would normally try to move forward for 20 more pulses before considering itself free. there was some handling for this that had some issues so now you can set a value such as this one to force a faster \"im unstuck\" process. - the higher your framerate, the higher you want this value. 5 may not be enough on better computers and you may end up getting restuck again, it will look like what we are calling \"snaking\". If you notice yourself \"snaking\" then this would be the first value to try increasing. /stick set diststuck #.## - diststuck defaults to 0.5 - this is similar to before in that it is the amount of distance you need to have moved versus your average pulse rate in order to not be stuck - this value should properly scale for all speeds of computers. you may want to set it higher or lower, play with it and find what works best (and please let us know!!), but keep in mind setting this value to something tiny such as 0.001 as we did in the old logic should no longer be necessary. deadchicken has determined that mindset was only working because of some incorrect math in the formulas. try to stick with more logical values and then reporting back your results would be appreciated. '''The following needs more testing/information: stucklogic behavior when snared stucklogic behavior underwater stucklogic behavior when mounted \\(all different speeds of mounts\\) ''' Please note the old values and logic behind setting them no longer applies. I've changed their names in the INI so that no one can mistakenly use crappy settings because they did not read any of this. Added jumping support, which will try to jump to overcome obstacles. For as simple as this sounds, this will prevent you from getting stuck on small obstacles the majority of the time. It works awesome, to the point we had to disable it to test a lot of the other aspects of the new formulas. This defaults to true, so if undesired you may disable this with /stick toggle trytojump \\(or set on/off\\) Stucklogic now uses GetDistance3D instead of GetDistance to compare movement between pulses, so changes in z axis should be factored into movement. This should correct the bug with stucklogic firing when walking up and down inclines, but please report if it is working as intended or not. It was working correctly in our testing. Rewrote a lot of the main function to reduce the number of evaluations processed per pulse by 30% (made up figure, it was a large portion) Bards can once again use AutoPause \\(all aspects except casting spells\\) /stick snaproll should now be 100% accurate and no longer overshoot the target due to getting stuck along the way. Thanks deadchicken for his camp scatter math which worked perfectly for this formula too. Please report any cases where it is having problems, but I hope there should be none now. Switching targets mid-stick will no longer trigger stucklogic or breakonwarp. If you target a mob that is out of server-update radius, breakonwarp can still fire once you receive accurate location data for the target. Cross-map targeting stuff is bad, let alone with stick still on . breakdist may now be set in game with /stick set breakdist #.## Added a new feature to MakeCamp courtesy of deadchicken: scattering. This is a bit complex but when configured properly it is amazing. The idea behind this is that instead of returning to a random location within your camp radius, you can define a specific bearing, distance, and scatter radius from the center of your camp. This way you could configure your characters to return to specified areas all the time. The INI supports values on a character by character basis as well, so you could configure your tank to return to the center, your casters to return behind the tank, and your melee to return to the sides of the tank. To configure the values the commands are: /makecamp toggle usescatter Turn on/off scattering /makecamp set bearing #.## - set scatter bearing /makecamp set scatsize #.## - set scatter radius /makecamp set scatdist #.## - set scatter distance Leash length can now be set to >= camp radius, instead of just > AltCamp now retains its own radius size. Added new MakeCamp TLO's relating to the distance from your camp. ${MakeCamp.CampDist} - float - distance from your current camp \\(0.00 if makecamp is off\\) ${MakeCamp.AltCampDist} - float - distance from your altcamp \\(0.00 if altcamp has not been established\\) ${MakeCamp.AltRadius} - float - radius size of your altcamp MoveTo now allows for ArrivalDist to be set as low as 1.0. MoveTo now has the option to turn on walk when closing in on the arrival destination to maximize precision. This defaults to true so if you do not want to use this, then /moveto toggle usewalk . Autosave \\(save to INI when issuing a _set_ or _toggle_ parameter\\) now defaults to true. Added savebychar as optional for the INI. Defaults to true as that was the old behavior. Use */stick toggle savebychar* to disable saving/loading character-specific settings. Added optional INI value YourCharName \"DisregardMe=true\". This allows you to use character-specific settings but ignore them on a specific character and use defaults instead. Manually add this line for the characters you wish to use defaults on, and leave it off \\(or you could put =false, but no need\\) for those you wish to continue using specifics. Fixed a crash bug related to using /stick id 2mooks . The \"id\" parameter now enforces all numerics. strtoul ftw. Fixed a bug with stick 'always' not processing mpause/mousepause/breakonkb/breakonmouse if you had a target when you issued the command, until you had no target and got a new target again. Fixed a small bug with min/max delays requiring 126 instead of 125 difference. Fixed a bug where if you unloaded the plugin mid-command walk would be left on. Fixed a bug with breakonsummon firing the first time you issued a command. Disabled advancedautopause as I'm out of ideas. checkbard has been removed \\(forever\\) . Stripped /followpath from this plugin. Use MQ2AdvPath instead. Other new set / toggles: /circle set circleradius #.## - set radius on the fly /makecamp set leashlength #.## - set leashlength on the fly /makecamp set campradius #.## - set camp radius on the fly /makecamp toggle leash - toggle leash on and off Cleaned up the debug command output. Cleaned up the help command output. Added new help command format to display detailed information on the plugins settings as it has grown large. \\(_/stick help settings_\\) All options that could previously be toggled or previously be set on/off now may be used both ways. So for example autopause, you have the option of doing: /stick toggle autopause /stick set autopause off /stick set autopause on Use the \"help settings\" parameter for more information. === Beta - 8.1205 - deadchicken polar math === Corrected the bugs with BreakOnSummon that would cause occasional misfires in /stick , and consistent misfires with /circle . This feature now works as intended \\(and its very useful in gm-detection detection\\) . deadchicken has generously offered up his polar-math code for camp returns, which is much smoother, more seamless, and far more accurate in generating a return to camp. This also makes /makecamp player work much better. Many thanks to deadchicken for this simple yet elegant contribution to the plugin.","title":"Beta - 8.1221 - deadchicken stucklogic rewrite"},{"location":"plugins/community-plugins/mq2moveutils/mq2moveutils-v11-revisions/#beta-81202-makecamp-cleanup","text":"makecamp return delay and mpause/mousepause resume delay are now on separate values. They are now able to be configured independently via commandline or within the INI. Important: The old ini values no longer apply, so if you use non-default settings you need to adjust them again based on the following \\(you can use any command, its not restricted to _/makecamp_\\) To set the delays for camp return /makecamp set campmindelay #.## /makecamp set campmaxdelay #.## - - To set the delays for mpause/mousepause return: /makecamp set pausemindelay #.## /makecamp set pausemaxdelay #.## You will now need to use different INI values for these delays. Defaults \"MinDelay\" and \"MaxDelay\" no longer do anything. For mpause/mousepause: [Defaults] PauseMinDelay=125 PauseMaxDelay=250 For makecamp return times: [MakeCamp] MinDelay=250 MaxDelay=500 The ${MakeCamp.MinDelay} and ${MakeCamp.MaxDelay} members now refer to the campmindelay and campmaxdelay settings only There are new TLO members for the pausemindelay and pausemaxdelay settings: ${MoveUtils.PauseMinDelay} and ${MoveUtils.PauseMaxDelay} This change has allowed for the return of inline min/max delay for makecamp, you can use it as it was before. Examples: /makecamp mindelay 150 maxdelay 500 /makecamp on maxdelay 500 /makecamp on mindelay 150 maxdelay 500 There is now the ability to retain an \"altcamp\" location stored. Right now this is only used for one purpose, being able to return to the altcamp location. This is very barebones at the moment, and works as follows You go to a location and turn on a camp \\(ie /makecamp on\\) You turn off your camp \\(ie /makecamp off\\) The location that was your camp is now the altcamp location. You now have two options to utilize the old camp: At any time, as long as you remain in the same zone, you can /makecamp altreturn . This will return you to the altcamp location, aka the location of your camp that is now off. This works how makecamp return with no camp active tried to work, but without the bugs that existed with it. You move to another location and setup a new camp \\(ie _/makecamp on_\\) . With this new camp active, you can /makecamp altreturn . This will turn OFF your current camp \\(so as not to get stuck trying to stay there\\) and move to the altcamp location. * Note: You cannot altreturn until you've setup a camp at least once in the current zone. * Note: The Altcamp values reset if you die or zone. * Note: You cannot altreturn if currently using a player-camp. There are two new TLO members that keep track of the altcamp location. If they are both == 0.0 then you do not have an altcamp setup. They are ${MakeCamp.AltAnchorX} and ${MakeCamp.AltAnchorY} The \"on\" parameter for /stick may now be used anywhere inline again, since removing that broke popular macros like RH. Please note the on parameter is useless in this version of MoveUtils. In the original version it was able to overcome a bug with breakonwarp \\(which is fixed\\) , so now it does nothing that any other /stick parameter does not do. This is only for retro-support, using it in your macros is bad practice. If you use precisey or precisex as a parameter in your /moveto command, it will now display your YDist or XDist values in the output \\(sorry for the long delay in this request\\) Added an experimental features for those of you bards that are having the \"jittery\" problem when StuckLogic is enabled. Following the suggested quickfix earlier in the thread, if you enable a new option checkbard , your speedmultiplier is divided by two if you are a bard class. This only applies to bards, not everyone with selos. This feature is disabled by default, so if you wish to test it, use \\(_/stick set checkbard on\\|off_ then _/stick save_\\) . This saves to the ini under Defaults \"CheckBard\" Turning this on as a non-bard will not do anything, so turning it on for your bard alt and loading up another character will not affect your non-bard. If this solution works, I could work on detecting if selo's is present and open this to all classes, but I think it would be better to find out what the problem in the stucklogic formula is, and try to fix that instead. If you wish to help, please read a few posts back about the formula and issues. For those of you who wish to return to camp when you are outside of the camp radius, regardless of if you have a target or aggro, there is a new option ReturnNoTarget. The previous new feature ReturnNoAggro will ignore target as well, but only return if you do not have aggro. ReturnNoTarget works with ReturnNoAggro OFF, and will return when you exceed the camp radius, target or not. Thanks to Muley for the suggestion. Usage \\(**/makecamp enforced**\\) : /makecamp set returnnotarget on|off This saves to the INI [MakeCamp] ReturnNoTarget=on Identified a bug with snaproll where it would not stop moving/readjust heading if stucklogic kicked in or if the player moved with mpause/mousepause in the middle of the roll. I've taken steps to correct the issue. If you are close to the target, the problem should be gone unless your snaproll runs you into a wall. If you are far away from the target, there is a chance your roll will still continue on beyond the normal distance \\(due to stucklogic or mousepause/mpause\\) but it will now halt if it travels the same distance beyond the target that you were when you issued the command. The problem would still exist if you snaprolled from 100 units away, got stuck along the way, you will run 100 units beyond the mob before snaprolling. I'm working on a better formula to address this problem. In the meantime, snaproll still works as it did before, just with more checking and correction of heading/movement. Shortrolls should have little to no problem. This feature will be improved in the future. Cleaned up the help command output to reflect new settings that were missing, or settings that no longer applied. A few of the newer ones may still be missing.","title":"Beta - 8.1202 - makecamp cleanup"},{"location":"plugins/community-plugins/mq2moveutils/mq2moveutils-v11-revisions/#beta-81123-loose-enhancement","text":"Rewrote loose heading to be calculated and adjusted within this plugin, using a fixed turn increment Note: the maximum rate you turn when holding the right/left keys down is 16.0, and hence the default This turn increment can be configured by the user for any number within 12.0 and 24.0 Lower than 12.0 will cause awkward stuttering Higher than 24.0 is noticeable hax and you may as well use fast heading To configure in game, you may use /stick set turnrate 12.0 If you use a value out of bounds, it will not change the rate To configure in the ini, you may use Defaults \"TurnRate\" section If you use a value out of bounds, it will use the plugin default of 16.0 and resave this value to your ini Adjusted /stick snaproll to use this new math, and improved the calculations to determine when to roll so it should no longer roll early","title":"Beta - 8.1123 - loose enhancement"},{"location":"plugins/community-plugins/mq2moveutils/mq2moveutils-v11-revisions/#beta-81119-minor","text":"Removed ${Stick.Aggro} TLO Added ${MoveUtils.Aggro} TLO this TLO now functions any time you have a target instead of only when /stick is active This check is still calculated the same way, it is not \"true\" aggro detection This checks your target's heading relative to your heading via angular distance math.

This will defeat the purpose of melee range checking but would be good for increasing the number for macros that use too small of number or something along those lines. It is there if you can find a use for it. Added output for modchanges without any verbosity check \\(will move it to Verbosity once its all correct\\) so you can see these actions taking place.

CastTime of -1 in the INI file now causes the default delay to be used. 06-01-04 \u00b6 Added LONGSONG_ADJUST (default to 1 tick) to help with the timing of recasting long songs, such as selo's.

This is for songs like Selos 2.5 min duration, etc. * Note that this makes no attempt to recover if the song effect is dispelled, your macro will need to take care of that. Added ability to compile-time change the method used for clicking items. 04-13-04 \u00b6 Changed /circle command to allow calling w/o specifying loc Corrected a problem with multiple consecutive missed notes Added handling of attempting to sing while stunned Command: /twist slots, to list the slot to # associations Command: /twist reload, to reload the ini file on the fly Command: /twist end, /twist off as aliases for /twist stop Command: /sing #, as an alias for /twist hold # Added support for item clickies.
