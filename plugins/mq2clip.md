## Description

**MQ2Clip** (by Cr4zyb4rd) is a plugin that adjusts the EQ clip plane to a set amount (usually
the minimum) when the session is in the background. This is fantastic for multiple EQ sessions on the same PC, since it
reduces the CPU load by lowering the clip plane on all background sessions.
