# MQ2Web

## Description

**MQ2Web** Created by ieatacid

The two offsets at the top will need to be updated after each patch, more than likely.
This adds the "/web" command. Follow it with a URL \("[http://](http://)" is added if you don't include it yourself\).
It works to open any web page. For instance, "/web google.com" opens the google home page.
You can find the latest version of MQ2Web [here](https://macroquest2.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=50&t=15101).
