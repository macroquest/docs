# MQ2AutoSkills

## Description

MQ2AutoSkills, developed by Cr4zyb4rd, is a plugin that attempts to use combat or other skills whenever they're available \(and the pre-requisite conditions are met\). It also has the ability to turn off attack during ENRAGE or Infuriate.

Currently supported skills are:

* Backstab
* Bash
* Begging
* Disarm
* Dragon Punch
* Eagle Strike
* Flying Kick
* Frenzy
* Evade
* Forage
* Feign Death
* Intimidation
* Kick
* Mend
* Pick Pockets
* Round Kick
* Sense Traps
* Slam
* Taunt
* Tiger Claw

The plugin can be downloaded from [here](https://macroquest2.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?t=9079).

**Note:** This plugin was developed many years ago and has been superceded by other more fully-featured plugins, the most popular being [MQ2Melee](mq2melee.md).

## Commands

In order for MQ2AutoSkills to use any of your skills, you must have the skill mapped to an ability button.

`/autoskills list` - List available skills and whether they are enabled<br>
`/autoskills settings` - List settings/thresholds<br>
`/autoskills backoff [#]` - %HP at which to not re-engage after FD/Evade<br>

## Examples

* For a Warrior, you could use something like the following

`/autoskills taunt`<br>
`/autoskills bash`<br>
`/autoskills melee 15`<br>

* For a Berserker , trying to optimize dps while watching cooldown timers

`/autoskills Frenzy`<br>
`/autoskills Volley`<br>
`/autoskills War Cry`<br>

## Bugs

Trade/Vendor windows and possibly some other events may cause some skills to fire when not appropriate and spam you.
