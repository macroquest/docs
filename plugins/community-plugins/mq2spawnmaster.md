# MQ2SpawnMaster

### Description

**MQ2SpawnMaster** \[By Cr4zyb4rd\]

Those of you already familiar with the Digitalxero's SpawnAlert plugin will notice a lot of that functionality here \(though hopefully without the crashing and other oddities\) though the intended use of this plugin starts where that one leaves off.

/spawnmaster by itself will give you a short help, the commands so far are fairly simple, but will probably become complex as development moves forward. Search strings are stored per-zone in an INI file. Two search types are currently supported, case-sensitive exact match \(the type created by calling '/spawnmaster add' with a spawn targetted\) and a case-insensitive sub-string match \(created with "/spawnmaster add "search string", although prefacing the string with a

## will indicate an exact-match type\). Both currently only check against the name EQ displays, although future versions

will support for exact matches against Some\_Mob\_00 and so on.

The plugin currently stores the mob's x/y/z location, the system and in-game time of spawn, and SpawnID\#, though not all of this information is made available in-game. When a mob dies or depops a system and in-game timestamp are also added.

Anything set in the OnSpawnCommand key in the Settings section of the INI fille will be executed as a command when the spawn is first matched so that for example "/speak ${SpawnMaster.LastMatch} just spawned!" will give you a nice spawn alert if using the MQ2Speech plugin.

You can find the latest version of MQ2 [here](https://macroquest2.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=50&t=9853&hilit=mq2spawnmaster).
