# MQ2Events

## Description

**MQ2Events** allows you to configure a reaction to any text-based event. For example, if you want to /cry when the text "has become ENRAGED" appears, you're in the right place.

## Commands

`/event [option] [<name> <trigger text|command text>]` - Adds, lists, deletes, and controls all events.<br>
`/eventdebug [on|off]` - Turns event debugging on or off.<br>

### Variables

```text
EventArg1 these are set acording to last event triggered and correspond to #1# .. #9#
EventArg2 these are not cleared so you can have one event use #9# and once set it will stay set until another #9# is encountered.
EventArg3
EventArg4
EventArg5
EventArg6
EventArg7
EventArg8
EventArg9
```
