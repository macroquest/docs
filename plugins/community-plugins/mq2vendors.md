# MQ2Vendors

## Description

**MQ2Vendors** is a plugin that will check a merchant's item list when you open that merchant, and will then notify you if the merchant has any items that you are looking for.

* If the vendor has an item you are looking for, you will be notified in the MQ chat window, and the merchant's name

  will be enclosed in &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \&lt;\&lt;\&lt;\&lt; to highlight you to it.

* **Note:** You will not be notified if the vendor item is a default item on that vendor \(ie. if it does not have a

  quantity in the merchant window\).

MQ2Vendors was created by Ceghkmv and can be found [here](https://macroquest2.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?p=109662#109662).

## Commands

* **/vendor add\|remove \&lt;**_**ItemID\|ItemName\|ItemLink**_**&gt;**

Add/remove the relevant name/ID to/from the watch list. **Note:** Names are case sensitive! You can also use EQ links instead of the name, and this is recommended, to ensure you get the correct capitalization.

* **/vendor list**

List all items in the watch list.

* **/vendor savevendors\|nosavevendors**

This enables or disables saving of vendors' default item list to a local INI file.

## Top-Level Objects
