`Support "swap in and click" items`

### 09-15-04

`Support extra spell slot from Omens of War AA`

### 09-01-04

`Command: /twist quiet to toggle some of the spam on/off`
`Various code fixes/speedups`

### 08-29-04

`Moved LONGSONG_ADJUST into INI file and made /twist adjust command to set it on`
`the fly`

### 08-25-04

`Changed output for /twist once to be slightly less misleading`
`Reset click/song timers every time they're called with /twist hold or /twist once;`
`if the user's specifying that song, they obviously want to cast it anyway.`
`Removed the variable MissedNote as close inspection revealed the only place it was`
`checked for was the line that set it. /boggle`
`Minor code tweaks, cleanups, formatting changes, etc`

### Pheph 08-24-04

cleaning up use of MQ2Data

`Modified it to use only one TLO, as I found it somewhat messy having 4 different ones.`
`All the functionality of the old TLO's are now members of ${Twist}`
`${Twising} is now ${Twist.Twisting}, or just ${Twist}`
`${TwistCurrent} is now ${Twist.Current}`
`${TwistNext} is now ${Twist.Next}`
`${TwistList} is now ${Twist.List}`

### 08-23-04

`Reset_ItemClick_Timers was being called far too often. Now the only time we reset`
`is if a new list of songs are specified. "/twist ${TwistList}" is a useful alias`
`if you for some reason want the old behavior.`
`Sing or /twist hold now resets the cast/item timer for that song only, rather than`
`the entire list.`
`Command: /twist reset calls Reset_ItemClick_Timers without interfering with the`
`state of the current twists.`

### 08-22-04

`Command: /twist once [songlist] will cycle through the songs entered once, then`
`revert to the old twist, starting with the song that was interrupted.`
`Removed command "/twist on", it was making the string compare for "once" annoying,`
`and I didn't think it was worth the effort for a redundant command.`
`/twist delay with no argument now returns the delay without resetting it. Values`
`less than 30 now give a warning...maybe they're not bards or have some other`
`reason for using a low value.`

### Cr4zyb4rd 08-19-04

taking over janitorial duties

`Minor revamp of item notification. Removed ITEMNOTIFY define and kludged in some`
`changes from Virtuoso65 to get casting by item name working. /cast is no longer`
`used.`
`Added INI file support for above change. File now uses distinct entries for item`
`names and slots. *Quotes not required for multi-word item names in INI.*`
`Fixed the MQ2Data value TwistCurrent to display the current song as-advertised, and`
`added a new value TwistNext with the old behavior of showing the next song in the`
`queue. (Useful in scripting)`
`Removed a few DebugSpews that were mega-spamming my debugger output.`
`CastTime of -1 in the INI file now causes the default delay to be used.`

### 06-01-04

`Added LONGSONG_ADJUST (default to 1 tick) to help with the timing of recasting long`
`songs, such as selo's.`
`Twisting is now paused when you sit (this would include camping). This fixes`
`problems reported by Chyld989 (twisting across chars) and Kiniktoo (new autostand on`
`cast 'feature' in EQ makes twisting funky)`

### 05-19-04

`Added workaround for incorrect duration assumption for durationtype=5 songs, such as`
`Cassindra's Chant of Clarity or Cassindra's Chorus of Clarity.`
`Added check of char state before casting a song. Actually added for 1.05`
`Checked states and resulting action are:`
`Feigned, or Ducking = /stand`
`Stunned = Delay`
`Dead - Stop twisting.`
`If you're a monk using this to click your epic, you'll want to disable the autostand on feign code =)`

### 05-05-04

`Fixed CTD on song unmem or death, while twisting. Oops`
`Removed circle functionality. It's better suited for a plugin like the MQ2MoveUtils`
`plugin by tonio at`[`http://macroquest.sourceforge.net/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?t=6973`](http://macroquest.sourceforge.net/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?t=6973)

### 05-01-04

`Fixed problem with using pchar before state->ingame causing CTD on eq load (thanks MTBR)`
`Fixed vc6 compile error w/ reset_itemclick_timers`
`Replaced various incantations of pChar and pSpawn with GetCharInfo()`
`Fixed /circle behavior w/ unspecified y/x`
`Fixed /circle on when already circling and you want to update loc`
`Added output of parsed circle parameters on start.`

### 04-25-04

`Converted to MQ2Data`
`Top Level Objects:`
`bool Twisting (if NULL plugin is not loaded)`
`int TwistCurrent`
`string TwistList`
`Removed $Param synatax for above`
`Added check to make sure item twists specified are defined`
`Fixed error with twist parameter processing`
`Changed twist startup output to be more verbose`
`Command: /twist on added as alias for /twist start`
`INI File is now named per-character (MQ2Twist_Charname.ini)`
`* Be sure to rename existing ini files`
`Modified twist routine to take into account songs with`
`non-0 recast times or longer than 3 tick durations,`
`and only re-cast them after the appropriate delay.`
`This is for songs like Selos 2.5 min duration, etc.`
`* Note that this makes no attempt to recover if the song`
`effect is dispelled, your macro will need to take care`
`of that.`
`Added ability to compile-time change the method used for`
`clicking items.`

### 04-13-04

`Changed /circle command to allow calling w/o specifying loc`
`Corrected a problem with multiple consecutive missed notes`
`Added handling of attempting to sing while stunned`
`Command: /twist slots, to list the slot to # associations`
`Command: /twist reload, to reload the ini file on the fly`
`Command: /twist end, /twist off as aliases for /twist stop`
`Command: /sing #, as an alias for /twist hold #`

`Added support for item clickies. Clickies are specified`
`as "gem" 10-19. For example, /twist 1 2 10 12`

`Added INI file support for storing item clicky info`
`and default twist delay.`

### 04-11-04

`Integrated the /circle code from Easar, runs in a circle. type`
`/circle for help.`

### CyberTech 03-31-04
