# MQ2Melee

## Description

**MQ2Melee**, written by s0rCieR, is designed to provide intelligent use of SHORT TIME REUSE MELEE ABILITIES and PET HANDLING during combat, depending on current combat conditions. It was developed to replace melee-oriented functions typically used in macros.

* MQ2Melee 7.09 Updated by Maskoi 02/17/2016 can be found [here](https://macroquest2.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=50&t=19600), in the VIP Plugin Forum.
* 6.0 Updated by Teichou 12/02/2012 for RoF, can be found [here](https://macroquest2.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=50&t=18581)
* 5.0 and so on can be found [here](https://macroquest2.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=50&t=18040)
* Previous versions can be found [here](https://macroquest2.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?t=12779).

### History

The inspiration for MQ2Melee was [MQ2AutoSkills](https://macroquest2.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?t=9079) and [MQ2ThrowIt](https://macroquest2.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?t=11295). All credit for the concepts should go to Cr4zyb4rd and Bushdaka, authors of those plugins.

## Supported Abilities

### Combat Abilities

* See MQ2Melee Supported AA's, Combat Abilities, Skills & Spells by Class

### Alternate Advancement Abilities

* See MQ2Melee Supported AA's, Combat Abilities, Skills & Spells by Class

### Melee Disciplines

* See MQ2Melee Supported AA's, Combat Abilities, Skills & Spells by Class

### Detected Disciplines

The following Disciplines are detected to promote some combat abilities:

* Ashenhand Discipline, Assassin Discipline(3), Silentfist Discipline, and Thunderkick Discipline.

### Skills

* See MQ2Melee Supported AA's, Combat Abilities, Skills & Spells by Class

### Spell Handling

* Provoke can be configured to cast any AA, disc or spell. It will auto-detect if you lose aggro, and then attempt to use any of the defined spells to regain it.
* To determine the proper Spell ID for any Discipline, Alternate Ability or Spell to be used with the provoke/stun commands use one of the following commands:
    * For Disciplines use: **/echo ${Me.CombatAbility[${Me.CombatAbility[_name_]}.ID}**, replacing with the name of the Discipline.
    * For AAs, use **/aa info** . The first number (before the AA name) is the Spell ID.
    * For Spells, use **/echo ${Spell[_name_].ID}**, replacing  with the spell name.
* Alternatively, you can look on [Lucy](http://lucy.allakhazam.com/) for the discipline/spell/AA and get the ID from there.
* Some common discipline IDs are listed below:
    * Ancient Chaos Cry [id=5016]
    * Bazu Bellow [id=6173]
    * Bellow [id=4681]
    * Bellow of the Mastruq [id=5015]
    * Berate [id=4682]
    * Incite [id=4697]
    * Mock [id=8467]
    * Provoke [id=4608]
    * Crippling Strike [id=468]
* Stuns can also be configured to cast any AA, disc or spells when MQ2Melee detects that your target begins to cast a spell.
* Provoke and Stun have built-in values, but they can always be overwritten using the command line (eg. **/melee provoke0=5015**) or by editing the** _**provoke0**_ setting in the INI file and then typing **/melee reload** in game.

## Commands

* All options below are listed with on/off as the arguments used to enable/disable the option, however **true** or **1** can be used in place of **on**, and **false** or **0** can be used in place of **off**.
    * Example: **/melee on aggro=on taunt=on kick=1 bash=0 intimidation=false disarm=true**
* **/melee** by itself will list all abilities and settings that are available to you. Some settings are dependant on others being active, so may not show up until you enable the prerequisite option.
* To find the relevant Item IDs for the various options, you can use the following command:
    * **/echo ${FindItem[=].ID}**, replacing with the name of the item you are looking for (no need to use quotes). Eg. /echo ${FindItem[=Blade of Carnage].ID} results in "25210".

* [_bool_](../../reference/data-types/datatype-bool.md) **${Melee.Enrage}**

  Is kill target enraged?

* [_bool_](../../reference/data-types/datatype-bool.md) **${Melee.GotAggro}**

  TRUE/FALSE if current target seems to be aggroed on you \(not perfect\).

* [_bool_](../../reference/data-types/datatype-bool.md) **${Melee.Immobilize}**

  TRUE if you have been standing still for more then 250ms, FALSE if not.

* [_bool_](../../reference/data-types/datatype-bool.md) **${Melee.Infuriate}**

  TRUE if kill target is infuriated!

* [_int_](../../reference/data-types/datatype-int.md) **${Melee.MeleeMode}**

  Maximum distance to target to be considered in melee range.

* [_int_](../../reference/data-types/datatype-int.md) **${Melee.RangeMode}**

  Minimum distance to target to be considered in archery range.

* [_string_]() **${Melee.Status}**

  Current plugin status, can be one or more of the following: ENGAGED, WAITING, MELEE, RANGE, ENRAGE, INFURIATE,

  BACKING, ESCAPING, FEIGNING, EVADING, FALLING, STEALING, BEGGING.

* [_int_](../../reference/data-types/datatype-int.md) **${Melee.Target}**

  SpawnID of current valid kill target, otherwise 0.

* [_float_](../../reference/data-types/datatype-float.md) **${Melee.ViewAngle}**

  Angle of view with current target.

Debugging TLOs:

* [_int_](../../reference/data-types/datatype-int.md) **${meleemvb\[**idskill**\]}**

  1 if the skill is ready and target in range, 0 if not. Most combat and/or character kills that can use an ID are

  testable here. Examples of _idskills_ are: **idleopardclaw**, **idslam**, **idforage**, **idfrenzy**,

  **idtigerclaw**, **idescape**.

* [_int_](../../reference/data-types/datatype-int.md) **${meleemvi\[**variable**\]}**

  1/0 if the variable is set to on/off. This includes all variables that can be set on the command line.

* [_string_]() **${meleemvs\[**option**\]}**

  Evaluates _option_ based on the current conditions and target. _Options_ are all the INI options that contain

  command lines that need to be evaluated. Examples are: **bashif**, **beggingif**, **tauntif**, **holyshit0**,

  **holyshit1**, **downshit1**, **slamif**, etc. Echoing one of these options will show you how they evaluate.

## INI File

MQ2Melee saves most options for each character in the INI file called \_.ini. Most options in the INI file are set using the command line \(/melee _command=on\|off_\) and they are best set this way, and not by editing the INI file. Any options given this way are then saved to the INI file when you issue the command **/melee save**. Options that contain macro commands are set by editing the INI file and then loading the values with **/melee load**.

### "IF" Options

* The following "IF" options can be set in the INI file. They will then be evaluated before the relevant disc/skill is

  triggered.

* They all need to take the form of ${If\[_condition_,1,0\]} statements and must return an integer. Any return of 0 is

  considered FALSE, any other integer is considered TRUE.

Eg. ${If\[${Me.Combat},1,0\]} will always be evaluated correctly.

* Your defined _condition_ must not exceed 255 characters, or it will cause the plugin to crash.

### Other Options

* stickcmd

This command takes a list of options that should be passed to the /stick command. Eg. "hold 15"

* downshit0-downshit7

Each one of these takes a macro command that will be run when you are not in combat. Remember, you have to enable each option with **/melee downflag\#=on**.

* holyshit0-holyshit7

Each one of these takes a macro command that will be run at the beginning of combat. Remember, you have to enable each option with **/melee holyflag\#=on**.

### HolyShit and DownShit

MQ2Melee now supports up to 20 macro command lines of each that will be executed when one of the following conditions are true:

* Holyshit:

Commands will be executed when in combat, no casting going on and the cursor is free.

* Downshit:

Commands will be executed when not in combat, not casting and the cursor is free.

When setting these commands, you must be careful not to fall into an endless loop or create a spam war. Make sure that when your line finishes, it will set up something that will force it to be FALSE for a while!

These Commands are turned on and off by downflagx and holyflagx if your downshit or holyshit parses ANY macro variables, you MUST set these flags to 2 instead of 1

## INI File Examples

* Please Note: Use this section only for adding useful examples that can be included in the INI file, not for

  copy/pastes of the INI files themselves. Anyone can see what a default INI is by loading up the plugin, running

  **/melee on**, **/melee save** and then opening the INI file in Notepad.

`; Will just echo that the macro is paused (this is stupid btw, but its an example.)`

## Optional Global INI File

MQ2Melee also has 3 global \(not character specific\) parameters that can be set in a second, optional INI file. MQ2Melee uses default values for these parameters unless it finds a file named MQ2Melee.ini that you created in the same directory. Here is an example of a MQ2Melee.ini file and a description of the parameters:

`[Settings]`
`SpawnType=10`
`MeleeKeys=z`
`RangeKeys=x`

* **SpawnType**: 0 + all desired target type modifier: \(+1 PC\) \(+2 NPC\) \(+4 PC PET\) \(+8 NPC PET\) \(+16 PC CORPSE\) \(+32

  NPC CORPSE\) default is 10 \(0 for base + 2 for NPC and + 8 for NPC PET\).

* **MeleeKeys**: Melee Attack Key \(not same as eq please unless you like problems\) default is z.
* **RangeKeys**: Range Attack Key default is x.

## Troubleshooting/FAQ

* **I have made changes to my INI settings. How do I activate the new settings?**

If you have MQ2Melee loaded and use an editor to make changes to your INI file, use **/melee load** to reload your settings. Alternatively, you can unload and reload the plugin.

* **I keep having to making changes to my melee settings from the command line. How do I save the new settings?**

From the command line type **/melee save**.

* **I can't get the StickCmd to work**

With Version 4 of the MQ2Melee plugin there was a change to the StickCmd, wherein it no longer requires "/stick" in the parameters. The old format of "StickCmd=/Stick hold 10 moveback" thus becomes "StickCmd=hold 10 moveback". Also you will have to execute **/melee stickmode=1** to tell the plugin to use stick arguments from ini and not built-in default /stick behaviour.

* \*\*I get the message "Exchange: -1 slot can not be Found" or "Item "XYZ" is not found" for potion belt enabled items

  and using in downshit & holyshit command lines\*\*.

Use /potionbelt activate \# Where as \#=the potionbelt slot your item in \(example for Haste potion that is in slot 2 of the potionbelt\) downshit6=/if \(${Spell\[Elixir of Speed X\].Stacks} && !${Me.Buff\[Elixir of Speed X\].ID} && !${Me.Moving}\) /potionbelt activate 2
