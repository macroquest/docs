# MQ2Chat

## Description

This plugin directs all of the MQ2 output to your main EQ chat window. **Be careful if doing a /report or /petition because MQ2 output will be visible in the /report lines that you send.**

By default, MQ2 output is set to go to a separate MQ2 window, which is handled by the [MQ2ChatWnd](mq2chatwnd/) plugin.
