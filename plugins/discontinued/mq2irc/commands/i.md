## Description

This is the main IRC slash command and controls most things related to IRC communication. All the commands below must be entered after you have connected with _/iconnect_.

* **help:** Show a list of commands that can be issued after /i.
* **nick:** Change your nick to _name_.
* **join:** Join the channel _\#channel_. The channel must have a \# in front of it.
* **part:** Leave _\#channel_. If no channel is given, it will leave the last-joined channel.
* **whois:** Display information available on _nickname_.
* **msg:** Send a directed message of "_text_" to _nickname_. This is the IRC equivalent of a tell.
* **say:** Speak "_text_" in the current channel. This _text_ will be visible to everyone in the channel.
* **raw:** Send _command_ to the server. This is useful for other IRC commands that are not available with /i \(eg. "/i

  raw list" to list all channels on the server\).

* **quit:** Leave the server \(same as the IRC command /quit\).
* **names:** List all nicknames on the current channel.
* **x:** _Not sure_.
