# MQ2Web

!!! warning

    This plugin is deprecated in live clients. The web browser component was removed from EverQuest.


## Description

> Created by ieatacid

The two offsets at the top will need to be updated after each patch, more than likely.
This adds the `/web` command. Follow it with a URL ("http://" is added if you don't include it yourself).

It works to open any web page. For instance, "/web google.com" opens the google home page.

You can find the latest version of MQ2Web [here](https://macroquest2.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=50&t=15101).


## Commands

* /web
* /web target = searches Allakhazam for your target's name if an NPC, Magelo if a PC
* Shift+click an item link looks up the item on Lucy
* Ctrl+click an item link looks up the item on EQItems
