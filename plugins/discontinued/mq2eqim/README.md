# MQ2EQIM

## Description

* Keeps your list of buddies (per character) and the last time they were seen online or on EQIM (by any character).

  Your friends list is automatically added as buddies.

* Notifies you when someone on your EQIM buddy list logs in or out.

**Note:** Since changing the EQ chat system to the Universal Chat System, this plugin \(and Sony's official EQIM\) no longer works.
